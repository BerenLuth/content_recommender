Google’s new Wifi mesh routers are now available for preorder - The Verge

Preorders are now open for Google’s new Wifi routers, along with an expected release date of December 6th, as noted by Droid Life. Google is selling the Wifi in two options, either as a single $129 device or a $299 bundle of three for use in a mesh network setup.
Similar to Eero’s multi-point mesh routers, the Wifi is designed to improve your wireless internet by using multiple routers scattered around an apartment or house. And like Google’s OnHub routers, the Wifi system is meant to automatically handle things like channel management and traffic routing to optimize speeds and efficiency.

Preorders for the Google Wifi are available from the Google Store, Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart, although like the recently released Google Home, the Wifi is US-only for the time being.
