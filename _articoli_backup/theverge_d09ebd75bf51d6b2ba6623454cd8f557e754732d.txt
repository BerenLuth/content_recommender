We’re officially one week away from Black Friday (or what’s technically considered Black Friday at least, since companies are starting earlier and earlier each year) and eBay is next up to join the Thanksgiving weekend sales.
The company announced its deals for both Black Friday — where the highlights are discounts on DJI drones a	nd Samsung TVs — and Cyber Monday, which will see a major sale on Apple’s 12.9-inch iPad Pro.
The deals aren’t live on eBay’s site just yet, but here’s the best of the company’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales so far:

Additionally, eBay will be running a weekend-long sale on DJI Phantom drones, with some models discounted up to 40 percent off, but the exact details have yet to be announced.
Correction: The DJI Phantom 4 is usually $1,199.99, not $1,499.99. The article has been updated to reflect this .
Update November 21st, 12:25PM: Added additional deals from eBay for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
