Google will take you on a 360-degree tour of the Kenai Fjords, Bryce Canyon, and other National Parks - The Verge

Google is celebrating the National Parks Service’s 100th anniversary with a new 360-degree "interactive documentary."The company sent film crews out to various National Parks to capture the natural wonders around them along with commentary from park rangers. Five parks are featured: Kenai Fjords National Park, Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park, Carlsbad Caverns National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park, and Dry Tortugas National Park.
Viewers can kayak through fjords, get up close with lava, deep sea dive around coral reefs, and explore dank caves. If you can’t make it to Alaska, New Mexico, Hawaii, Utah, or Florida this year, this might be your next best bet. The documentary’s available online and on the Google Arts & Culture App on iOS and Android. The videos also come with supplementary footage where viewers can look through artifacts from the National Parks museums. Get those Google Cardboards ready because nature is coming to you.
