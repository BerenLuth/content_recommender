Apple wants you to give the monster a chance - The Verge
Thomas Ricker
This year’s holiday ad from Apple has everything: a monster from on high, terrified citizens, and a song about Dixie that harkens back to the simpler days of yore. Watch as the mostly white populace embraces the repulsive creature as one of their own. It’s a story of inclusion at a time when much of America feels excluded, making it one of most poignant holiday ads so far.
