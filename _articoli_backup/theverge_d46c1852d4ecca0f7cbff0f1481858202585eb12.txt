How to bring back the startup chime on the new MacBook Pros - The Verge

Earlier this week, the news broke that the automatic boot feature on Apple’s new MacBook Pros — which causes the computer to start up when the lid is opened — came at a heavy price: the removal of the iconic Mac boot-up chime.

But, hope is not yet lost, as MacRumors forum user jessejarvi has figured out a way to bring back the classic startup sound effect. By going into the Terminal application (which is located in the Utilities folder inside your Applications folder) you can use the following commands to toggle the automatic boot-up and startup chime.
As a word of caution, this is modifying some stuff at a system level, so try this out at your own risk (although as command line work goes, this should be relatively harmless). Additionally, those hoping to use this method to enable the automatic boot-up on their older MacBooks are out of luck — the new feature is still exclusive to the updated MacBook Pros.
