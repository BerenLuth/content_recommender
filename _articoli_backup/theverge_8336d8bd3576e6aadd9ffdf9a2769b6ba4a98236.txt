Apple's Nike+ Watch launches on October 28th - The Verge
Tom Warren
Apple has quietly updated its Apple Watch Nike+ site to reveal the October 28th launch date of the wearable. Announced back in September, the special Nike-branded Apple Watch is a unique version of the Apple Watch Series 2 with a breathable watch band and Nike watch faces / complications. Nike has also created a Nike+ Run Club social space that integrates with its Nike+ Apple Watch, and has even carved its famous swoosh into the aluminum back of the Apple Watch.
You can pick between four different color options that mix together black, gray, silver, or yellow for the band part of the device, and all models are the standard aluminum case. Apple Watch Nike+ will debut on October 28th for the same price as the regular Series 2 Watch: $369 for a 38mm case or $399 for a 42mm version.
