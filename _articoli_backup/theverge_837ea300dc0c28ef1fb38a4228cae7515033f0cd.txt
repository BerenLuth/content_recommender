Virtual pop star Hatsune Miku is getting a virtual reality game - The Verge

Hatsune Miku is no stranger to the video game world, but the virtual pop star will soon be entering a new frontier: virtual reality. Sega has announced that a new Miku game is coming to PlayStation VR when the device launches in October. Called Hatsune Miku: VR Future Live, the game attempts to re-create the experience of a Miku concert set in a packed virtual stadium. (There’s no word on whether Anamanaguchi will be the opening act.) “As the lights dim and Miku gets ready to take the stage, the player's controller transforms into a glow stick,” Sega explains. After that, you’ll be treated to a one-on-one performance from the vocaloid on stage.
Unfortunately, we don’t know much else about the game, as Sega hasn’t revealed the price, nor any screenshots or video. But it won’t be too long before we find out: VR Future Live is launching on PSVR on October 14th.
