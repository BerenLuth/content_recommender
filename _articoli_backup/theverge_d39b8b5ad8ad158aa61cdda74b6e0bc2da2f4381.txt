This candle smells like a new Mac - The Verge
Dami Lee
In another episode of "Stop it tech, you're drunk," Apple accessory company Twelve South has releasedÂ a candle that smells like a freshly unboxed Mac. For just $24, you can enjoy a hand-poured, 100 percent soy wax candle with scents of mint, peach, basil, lavender, mandarin, and sage. I'm not sure how all that equates to the smell of a new Mac, but enough people have been hyped about this candle for it to sell out on the website.
Honestly, I can't remember what my Macbook Air smelled like the first time I unboxed it. Perhaps it was a mixture of excitement and vague anxiety at having just dropped the biggest sum of money I'd ever spent in my young adult life.
And where exactly should one place this candle in their homes? In the home office, next to your real Mac? In the kitchen, intermingling with the smells of a hot meal in the air? Choose wisely, because one good, strategically placed Mac candle could make your bathroom smell like an Apple Store. Is that what you want for your home?
