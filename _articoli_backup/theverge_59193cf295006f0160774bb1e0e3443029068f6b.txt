Gears of War 4 comes free with Nvidia's GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 cards - The Verge

Microsoft is teaming up with Nvidia to give away free copies of Gears of War 4. If you purchase a GTX 1070 or GTX 1080 as a graphics card, part of a system, or inside a laptop then you'll get a free copy of Gears of War 4. The promotion runs from today until October 30th, and as the game is Xbox Play Anywhere you'll get a copy of the PC version and Xbox One variant for free.
While graphics card game bundles are common on the PC side, it's unusual to see Microsoft pairing up with Nvidia. Microsoft currently uses AMD chips inside its Xbox One, but there's speculation the company may make the move to Nvidia in the future. Such a move would be surprising, especially for Xbox developers, but Microsoft is planning to release a more powerful "Project Scorpio" Xbox console next year. Microsoft hasn't revealed exact specs, but the GPU has the same memory bandwidth as Nvidia's GTX 1080 graphics card for PCs.
Gears of War 4 will debut on October 11th, and Microsoft revealed that the title went gold yesterday so there won't be any unexpected delays. Gears of War 4 also supports Cross Play across Xbox One and Windows 10 in all of the game's modes, furthering Microsoft's gaming alliance between PC and Xbox. If you play on both PC and Xbox One then all achievements and game progress is automatically synced between the two.
