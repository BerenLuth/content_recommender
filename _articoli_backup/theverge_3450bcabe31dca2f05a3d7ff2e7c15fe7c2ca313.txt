Amazon is making a giant Echo speaker with 7-inch touchscreen: Bloomberg - The Verge

Amazon is working on a new, Alexa-enabled speaker that would include a seven-inch touchscreen display, according to a report from Bloomberg. Citing sources close to the company, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that the speaker will be larger than Amazon’s Echo, and that it will be “tilted upwards” so that users can read the display. The device could be announced as early as the first quarter of 2017, according to Bloomberg.
Like the Echo, the new device can be controlled using Alexa, Amazon’s digital assistant, though users would also be able to pull up weather forecasts, news, and other content through the touchscreen display. The device will run FireOS, Bloomberg reports, and will likely be priced higher than the Echo, which is available for $180. The website also reports that the device will come with better-quality speakers, which could be positioned behind the touchscreen.
