Google's New York City pop-up shop is now open - The Verge
Dami Lee
Google's pop-up shop opened today in New York City, and it's a swanky space in the heart of SoHo for people to check out the Pixel, Google Home, and Daydream VR for themselves. The shop doesn't actually have any products for sale, though — you'll have to do that online or at Verizon and Best Buy retail stores.
The space showcases different products in different corners, with an IKEA-esque living room and kitchen setup where people can test out Google Home's features in a setting that looks like a home. There's also a Daydream VR area where you can sit on swivel low-poly rock chairs and try on the VR headsets, and a cool lighting installation where you can get your photo taken with a Pixel phone, which is meant to demonstrate the Pixel's low-lighting photography capabilities. Here's a photo taken with the Pixel:

The Made By Google pop-up shop is open Monday–Sunday from 10AM to 8PM. It's located at 96 Spring Street.
