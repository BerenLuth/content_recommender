Let this retro WordArt generator take you back to 1997 - The Verge
Kaitlyn Tiffany
Everyone I’ve ever met has warm, fuzzy feelings about the disaster of Microsoft Office’s Clippy and the hideous design choices of 1997-era Powerpoint. It’s hard to say why. Maybe it just reminds you of a simpler time, when all you were expected to do was type “Causes of the Cold War” in bubble letters in order to get a pat on the back and a gold star. Maybe you are just more at home with slowly blinking paper clips than you are people. Maybe 1997 is just generally your favorite year because that is when the Julia Roberts film My Best Friend’s Wedding was released. None of that is my business.
Today, designer Michael McMillan has introduced a free WordArt generator that you can use to make all kinds of beautiful words (with the help of Clippy, of course).
You can share your creations on Twitter, Facebook, or Tumblr, and there’s also an option to export your design to Zazzle and buy custom t-shirts, mugs, three-ring binders, or mousepads.
Party like it’s 1997!
