Watch Microsoft's Surface PC event in under 9 minutes - The Verge
Jacob Kastrenakes
Microsoft just spent a full two hours presenting the future of Windows 10 and its Surface line on stage in New York City. And it wasn't exactly padding out that time — aside from a lengthy demo of Paint (something I think no one expected in 2016), Microsoft really did have a lot to cover. You can read our roundup right here, and above, you can watch our trimmed down cut of the two-hour event, which puts it all into a much snappier eight-and-a-half minute presentation. When you're done, you can check out our hands on with the new Surface Studio right here.
