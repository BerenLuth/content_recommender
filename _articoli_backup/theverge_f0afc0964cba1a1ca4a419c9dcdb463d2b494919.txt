Spinn coffee thinks it’s better than pods, but who is really above pods? - The Verge
Ashley Carman
Pod tech creates both the worst and most encouraging gadgets. Tortilla pods? Dumb, but probably useful. Cookie pods? Insulting, but likely tasty. We all know that pod tech has its roots in the OG of pod machines: Nespresso. But now, a company called Spinn wants you to know that it too can make a convenient single-serving cup of coffee, without using wasteful, expensive pods.
The Spinn coffee machines vary in size but all are marketed as the future of coffee because they take whole beans, grind them, heat them, and brew them without any human interaction or plastic waste. Take that, pods. Spinn connects to a companion iOS / Android app over Wi-Fi so users can specify how they want their coffee done, or schedule a cup ahead of time, although this can also be done directly from the machine or through Alexa voice commands. Spinn can make a shot of espresso, or even a latte in its larger machines that come with milk steamers. The app also connects coffee drinkers with local roasting companies to order beans directly.
Spinn is available for preorder now, starting at $299. These are probably the coffiest coffee machines, and I have to admit, Spinn does have a point with the non-waste thing. Maybe we’ve evolved past pod tech? Is it possible?
Correction 11/23, 8:53 PM ET: Updated to reflect that Nespresso is the true OG of pod tech, not Keurig.
