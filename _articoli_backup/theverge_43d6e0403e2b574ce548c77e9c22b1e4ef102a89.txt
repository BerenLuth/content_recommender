Google is turning your phone into a magic wand for Fantastic Beasts tie-in - The Verge
Chaim Gartenberg
In case you haven’t heard, there’s a new Harry Potter movie coming out. We’re only a few weeks away now from the release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and Google is teaming up with Warner Bros. to help showcase the film with a series of Google service-based tie-ins.
The best of the Harry Potter integrations is that Google will allow you to turn your Android phones into a bona-fide magic wands. Using “OK Google” voice commands, you can now instruct your phone to turn on the flashlight with a Lumos spell, or shutter it with Nox. And of course, casting the Silencing Charm with Silenco will, logically, silence the ringer and notifications on the device. Honestly, I can’t see a single reason why Harry Potter spells shouldn’t immediately become the default control method for all voice commands going forward.
Google is also adding tours of locations in Fantastic Beasts using Google Street View, allowing fans to virtually visit the Magical Congress of the USA, The Blind Pig speakeasy, and the apartment of some of the films main characters.
Additionally, Google is planning a Fantastic Beasts Daydream VR experience for the Daydream View headset when it goes on sale later in November, along with a Fantastic Beasts sticker pack for use in Google Allo.
