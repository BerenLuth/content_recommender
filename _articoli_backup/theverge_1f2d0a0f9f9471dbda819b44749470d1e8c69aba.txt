Merge VR Goggles are now available at Target - The Verge
Micah Singleton
Merge is now selling its ultra-cheap VR Goggles which work with both iOS and Android devices in Target stores. Despite not being the most aesthetically appealing VR headset to wear, Merge does offer the cheapest multi-platform VR headset (outside of Google Cardboard) on the market. This would be a great entry device for people looking to give virtual reality a try. You can pick up the Merge VR Goggles onÂ Target.com and in physical stores today.
