Razer upgrades Blade Stealth laptop with new Intel CPU, more RAM, and a bigger battery - The Verge
Vlad Savov
The Blade Stealth, Razer’s 12.5-inch ultrabook, only made its debut in January of this year, but it’s already getting its first significant upgrade with a major spec bump. Headlining the new changes is a 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-7500U processor, part of the brand-new Kaby Lake generation of chips. It’s accompanied by a doubling of RAM and storage, taking the top spec up to 16GB of the former and 1TB of PCIe SSD space for the latter. The laptop’s battery capacity has also been improved by an appreciable amount, going from 45Wh to 53.4Wh. Equipped with a 4K (3840 x 2160) touchscreen display, a maxed-out Blade Stealth will set you back $1,799.
A powerful ultrabook that scales across multiple budgets
Most of Razer’s customers are likely to gravitate toward the $1,399 Blade Stealth config, which maintains the processor, memory, and battery upgrades, but is more modest in storage, with a 512GB drive, and display resolution, stepping down to Quad HD (2560 x 1440). $1,599 is the middle option, allowing you to regain the 4K display without bumping the storage.
Should your needs be more humble, Razer offers a $999 Blade Stealth with 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a Quad HD panel. That’s still a very decent spec sheet for a well designed Windows 10 ultrabook, which is exactly what the Blade Stealth is.
Of course, Razer’s intention is to ally the Blade Stealth with the Razer Core external GPU enclosure, which costs $499 by itself but gets discounted down to $399 when purchased alongside a Razer laptop. The Core also sees an update today, with Razer adding support for the latest Radeon 400 and Nvidia GeForce GTX 10 series of graphics cards. For the purposes of high-end gaming with the Core, the 16GB Stealth config should be considered a minimum, and the extra storage space now on offer with the laptop will also be a benefit with game installations growing ever larger.
The new Razer Blade Stealth is available to buy right away from Razer’s San Francisco store or razerstore.com. Microsoft’s online store and Amazon will follow later in the month.
