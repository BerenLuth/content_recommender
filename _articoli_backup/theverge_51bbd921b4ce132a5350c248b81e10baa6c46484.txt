Lyft will give you a 45 percent discount for one ride on Election Day - The Verge
Chris Welch
This coming Tuesday, Lyft will offer a 45 percent discount on one ride between 7AM and 8PM in 20 markets. The promotion will make it slightly cheaper to reach your local polling place if you’ve got no other way of getting there besides hailing a car. Getting back after voting will cost full price, however.
Since it’s only in select markets, Lyft says eligible users will receive an email on Sunday night where they can access the 45 percent discount in the Deals of the Week section. While this one-day promotion is meant to help get out the vote, there’s nothing really stopping you from taking a discounted ride elsewhere during those hours.
Meanwhile, Uber’s way of encouraging voters to reach the polls is a partnership with Google. When you open the Uber app on election day, you’ll be able to enter the address where you’re registered to vote and see where your polling station. Unfortunately, the leading car hailing service isn’t offering any discounts whatsoever — so you’ll have to Uber Pool it if you want to get there cheap. Both of these companies could be doing much more (like free rides strictly to and from polling places) if they wished. But Lyft’s at least taking off something.
Here’s the full list of markets where Lyft will offer 45 percent off for a single trip:
