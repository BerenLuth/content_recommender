Oculus adds support for four tracking cameras on the Rift - The Verge
Ashley Carman
Oculus Home was updated this past week to include support for up to four trackers on the Rift and Touch. This added functionality is likely a direct appeal to Steam game developers who haven't yet been able to develop motion-controlled games for the Oculus Rift, as the company prepares to release its Touch controllers later this year. Four trackers could ultimately improve accuracy and set a new standard for VR setups in the future, but still, it’s unclear how users are expected to set up all those USB connections. I hope they’ve got some creative cable techniques.
We still don’t have a release date for the Touch, although it’s been rolling out to developers and will supposedly come with at least 30 full games at launch. So far we've only seen it demoed with two tracking cameras, which mirror the HTC Vive's setup. The Vive, however, currently only supports two trackers and those are plugged into a power outlet as opposed to a USB port. If Oculus decides to go the four-tracker route, we might end up seeing more demoes between now and the Touch's release, which is expected closer to the holiday season.
Here's someone testing the Oculus Touch out with four trackers through SteamVR:
