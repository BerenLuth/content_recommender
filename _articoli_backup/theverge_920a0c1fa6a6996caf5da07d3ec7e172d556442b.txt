Do you love GoPros? Are GoPros your thing? GoPro knows you love GoPros, so today it announced a new backpack called the Seeker. It's for you, GoPro fan. It fits five GoPros inside. Five. It also comes with space for a bag of water, with its having a 16-liter compartment. But really, anyone buying this bag is doing so for the GoPro aspect. So, in addition to those five cameras you can stuff inside the Seeker's dedicated GoPro section, the backpack also comes with three mounting options: two over-the-shoulder ones and a chest mount. The Seeker is available on GoPro’s website for $169.99.
