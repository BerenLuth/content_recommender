Apple stops selling computer released in June 2012 - The Verge
Sam Byford
Apple just announced a new generation of MacBook Pro laptops, which means it's probably time to stop selling the prior range. Or at least the the one before it. Yes, the 13-inch MacBook Pro from June 2012, which made up for its lack of Retina display with an optical disc drive and an extra pound or so in weight, has finally been killed after inexplicably remaining on sale at $1,099 for years without a spec bump. New models are no longer on sale, although some refurbished units are still available.
So, pour one out if you really wanted a portable Mac with a DVD drive — you'll have to use Apple's USB SuperDrive accessory now. Possibly with a USB-C to USB-A adapter.
