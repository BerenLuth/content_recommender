Canon’s 5D Mark IV has built-in Wi-Fi and shoots 4K video - The Verge
Sean O'Kane
Canon today announced the 5D Mark IV, the fourth iteration of the company’s popular full-frame DSLR camera originally launched in 2005. It’s the first Canon 5D to shoot 4K video, and it’s also the first 5D to come with Wi-Fi connectivity and a touchscreen. The 5D Mark IV will be available in early September for $3,499.
Just about everything inside the 5D Mark IV is an upgrade over its predecessor, the 5D Mark III — welcome news, if a bit unsurprising, since that camera was released in 2012. The Mark IV employs an all-new 30.4-megapixel sensor, has a native ISO range of 100-32,000 (which is expandable to 50-102,400), and uses Canon’s Digic 6+ image processor. It gets a small bump up in shooting speed, too — 7 frames per second versus 6 on the Mark III.
While the Mark IV has the same size 3.2-inch LCD screen as the Mark III, the resolution gets a bump up to 1.62 million dots. Better yet, the panel is now touch-sensitive, which makes it possible for users to tap to select their focus point or to pinch-and-zoom when reviewing images. And the camera features Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity as well as built-in GPS, all firsts for a 5D.

The camera also uses Canon’s Dual Pixel autofocus system, where each pixel on the sensor is simultaneously capable of focusing and capturing light, increasing autofocus speeds. This reduces the need for the camera to "hunt," or rack past and then return to the correct focus, something that is especially helpful when shooting video.
It doesn't have everything videographers might want, but it's closer than ever
Canon’s 5D Mark II was the company’s first DSLR with video capabilities, and it helped spark a revolution in the amateur filmmaking world by blending video capture with the compact, adaptable nature of a DSLR. Though it’s still missing a few video-minded features found on some other Canon DSLRs, like the flip-out screen on the 70D and 80D, the 5D Mark IV is better equipped for video than any of its forebears. The camera shoots 4K (4096 x 2160) video at 30 or 24 frames per second, 1080p video at up to 60 frames per second, and 720p video at 120 frames per second. That makes it the first of Canon’s full-frame DSLRs to be able to shoot slow motion full-HD footage, and the first to offer the ability to shoot footage at 5x normal speed. It can even shoot HDR video, another first for the company.
Beyond the Mark IV, Canon also announced new versions of two of the company’s more popular lenses. The first is the 16-35mm f2.8L III, a super wide zoom lens that is popular with photojournalists as well as wedding, event, and concert photographers. One of the few knocks on the previous version of the 16-35mm, which was released in 2007, is that the focus around the edges of the image area tended to be soft. Canon says the new version will offer an increase in sharpness, especially at those edges, while adding in better dust and weatherproofing. The other new lens is a second version of Canon’s 24-105mm f4L zoom. Both lenses will be available in October for $2,199 and $1,099, respectively.
Correction: The post has been updated to clarify that the 5D Mark IV is the first 5D to shoot 4K, not the first Canon DSLR to do so.
