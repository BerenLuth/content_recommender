Apple's next fall event will be on October 27th, according to a new report from Recode, during which Apple is widely expected to unveil the next generation of the MacBook Pro. And it's about time.
The last time Apple significantly updated its top-of-the-line MacBook Pro was back in 2012. Since then, the laptop has been updated to include a Retina display and a Force Touch trackpad, but a major revamp has been long overdue.
Bloomberg has previously reported that a fall hardware event could include a new iMac desktop, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops, along with a new standalone 5K monitor. And it has been rumored that a new MacBook Pro will be slimmer than the existing one, with a flatter keyboard and a "Dynamic Function Row," or a touchscreen OLED strip in lieu of standard function keys.
Sales of Mac computers have often bucked the trend of declines in the PC market over the past few years, but even the Mac saw declines this year, according to global research firm IDC. In the second quarter, Mac sales dropped to 4.4 million from 4.8 million for the same period a year ago, with many people likely holding off on buying until the current lineup is refreshed.
The Verge plans to be live from Apple's event later this month, so stay tuned for more information and details.
