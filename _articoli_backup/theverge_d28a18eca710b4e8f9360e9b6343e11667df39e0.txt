Hitman Go is coming to VR tomorrow - The Verge
Andrew Webster
One of the best mobile games is getting a makeover in virtual reality.Â Hitman Go, the board-game-like spinoff of the stealth assassination series, is launching on both the Gear VR and Oculus Rift tomorrow. The two versions will cost $7.99 and $9.99, respectively, and will offer largely the same experience, though developer Square Enix notes that the Rift edition will offer "a 90 FPS game experience with seamless head tracking."
Hitman Go first launched as a mobile title in 2014, and offered a seemingly strange, but compelling twist on the Hitman formula; instead of a third-person action game, it was a turn-based strategy title, featuring a series of diorama-like levels that had you moving your assassin around like a piece in a board game, carefully plotting your path through the level. The game has since been ported to the PC and PlayStation 4.
In addition to offering a brand new perspective, the VR version of the game will feature 91 different levels, pulling from classic Hitman games like Blood Money and Silent Assassin.
