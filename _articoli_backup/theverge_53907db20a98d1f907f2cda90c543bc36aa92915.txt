Zotac's new VR Go mini PC comes with straps, so you don't have to buy a backpack - The Verge
Ashley Carman
Zotac has introduced multiple mini PCs that are VR-ready and able to fit in backpacks, but now the company is planning to release a computer that comes with removable straps attached, according to Anandtech. I love an all-in-one purchase. The VR Go PC is packed with:
Zotac put the HDMI, USB ports, and power connector on one side for easy cable management. The PC can also be taken off the straps and used as a regular desktop computer. Seriously, all-in-one purchases are a beautiful thing. Zotac didn’t provide info on a release date, price, or how long the battery will last. I know, I’m sorry. The company previously showed off a proof-of-concept VR backpack, so at least we're getting more details about that idea?
Zotac also debuted another new mini VR-ready PC this week called the Magnus ERX480. It runs Windows 10 and is approximately eight by seven by two inches. I’m not sure how much it weighs, but it can’t be much. I know it'll fit in a backpack. You’ll have to buy the backpack yourself, though. Sad.
