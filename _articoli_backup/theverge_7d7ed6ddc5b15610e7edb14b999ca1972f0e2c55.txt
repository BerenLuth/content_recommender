Angry man smashes iPhones and Macs at Apple Store in France - The Verge
Tom Warren
Apple customer support is often rated highly throughout the world, but that doesn't mean the company always avoids unhappy customers. A disgruntled customer in France entered an Apple Store in Dijon yesterday and calmly smashed devices in front of Apple staff and customers. At least 10 iPhones were smashed with a boule metal ball (used in a French bowls game), alongside a MacBook Air.
French media reports suggest the angry man, who actually calmly smashed devices, was complaining about his consumer rights and a refund. The man appears to have been detained outside the store, and there are no reports of injuries apart from the broken Apple equipment. Hopefully the angry man purchased multiple AppleCare protection plans, otherwise that's going to be a costly bill for thousands of dollars of property damage.
