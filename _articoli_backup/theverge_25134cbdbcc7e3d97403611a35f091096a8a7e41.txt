You can watch IMAX movies in Android's Daydream VR - The Verge
Jacob Kastrenakes
Here's something that could make Google's newly announced Daydream VR pretty epic in scope: IMAX experiences are going to start coming to the platform.
While unveilingÂ Daydream, Android's new virtual reality initiative, Google announced that it would include content from IMAX. It's supposed to let you watch IMAX movies in a "virtual IMAX theater." That's likely to mean IMAX's more traditional documentaries, rather than the major films that happen to have IMAX ratios, but it still means having some awe-inspiring imagery to look at.
A long list of other content partners are also said to be bringing their content to Daydream. That includes HBO, Lionsgate, and Hulu.
