Dell refreshes XPS 13 with new Intel chips, better battery life, and rose gold - The Verge

Dell's XPS 13 is one of our favorite Windows laptops, and today the company is upgrading the sleek PC's internals with the latest 7th generation Intel processors and other improvements that Dell claims lead to a boost in battery longevity. The XPS 13's exterior is also seeing some change; it's now available in "highly anticipated" rose gold — just like every other 2016 gadget. It looks like pretty standard gold in these product shots, but maybe the "rose" part is more visible in person.
Like previous revisions of the XPS 13, you can choose between a Quad HD+ touchscreen or Full HD 1080p display (which also offers an optional touchscreen SKU), with the latter capable of hitting 22 hours of battery life according to Dell's claims. Focusing on video and web browsing alone, Dell estimates the new XPS 13 can last for 13 hours straight. That'd be wonderful if true, but Dell tends to fall a bit short of its figures, so we'll need to test the machine directly to see if it actually reaches that target.
The move to Kaby Lake brings Dell up to par with some other laptops we've seen debut over the last couple months, notably Lenovo's Yoga 910 (which features a tiny bezel similar to the XPS) and Razer's Blade Stealth. You can choose from Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 configurations, with 4GB / 8GB / 16GB options for RAM and 128GB / 256GB / 512GB / 1TB for flash storage. Intel's HD Graphics 650 handles the video end, and the company is also talking up fast Wi-Fi performance thanks to the Killer 1535 AC hardware inside. The refreshed XPS 13 will begin shipping October 4th for prices starting at $1,499.99 for rose gold, or $799 if you're someone who can settle for plain old silver aluminum.
