PlayStation-branded wet wipes: the most essential part of any public VR experience - The Verge
Ross Miller
The average PlayStation VR demo here at E3 seems to be about 10–15 minutes. It takes maybe five minutes to get the headset off someone's face and onto another's. The E3 show floor is open approximately 21 hours across three days. A conservative estimate, then, would be that every single PlayStation VR headset here has been worn by over 60 people at various levels of hygiene and average perspiration rates.
So with that said, I am very, very, very thankful that every PlayStation VR demo area I've seen has a box of wet wipes to clean each headset between use. And since I've seen Sony brand everything from artisanal donuts to bottled water with the familiar PS insignia, why shouldn't these wet wipes be PlayStation-branded?
