Here's what you'll be playing with the new Oculus Touch controllers - The Verge

We finally know exactly what you'll be playing when Oculus' Touch controllers launch in December. Today at its Oculus Connect keynote, the company unveiled a number of new titles that will support its fledgling controllers, including apocalyptic sci-fi shooter Arktika.1 from the creators of the grim Metro series, and Lone Echo from Ready at Dawn, a narrative-driven game about being trapped on a space station. Epic Games, meanwhile, will release its own sci-fi first-person shooter called Robo Recall set in an iRobot-esque universe. Robo Recall will be available for free early next year.
In addition to games, Oculus announced that a number of art tools will be available for Touch in December as well. That includes both the Kingspray graffiti simulator, and illustration tool Quill.
All told Oculus Touch will have an expected 35 titles available at launch. Back in June, the company said that it would have more than 30 titles available for the launch the controllers. Several were already known — including Rock Band VR, Job Simulator, and The Climb — but today's announcement provides a better idea of the breadth of experiences that will support the controllers. The news comes just days before Sony is set to launch its first foray into virtual reality with PlayStation VR — a new headset that is joined by its own impressive lineup of launch games.
