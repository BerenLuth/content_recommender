MSI built a computer into a backpack so you can walk around in VR - The Verge
Jacob Kastrenakes
Do you wish you could take a computer with you everywhere — maybe one in a form factor that was easy to carry around? Like in, say, a backpack? MSI has been brilliant enough to put these desires together and create the Backpack PC, a PC that is literally built to be worn on your back.
Okay, so this is a ridiculous idea at first glance (and probably second and third and— ), but MSI does have an interesting reason for designing a PC this way: for virtual reality. Its intention is for gamers to buy the Backpack PC and wear it around while playing VR games. Doing so would mean that gamers would be able to walk around wherever they'd like, no longer limited by the length of the cords connecting their VR headset to their computer. This is similar to what VR theme park The Void is doing.
Maybe one day computers will be tiny enough to fit inside of backpacks
It's not totally clear how well this will work out, given that games will have to be created to specifically support this type of untethered movement. And for the most part, current VR games are planning for players to be relatively limited in where they can go.
MSI hasn't announced most specs for the Backpack PC yet, aside from mentioning that it'll have a Core i7 processor and a GeForce GTX 980 graphics card. The full unveiling will come at Computex next week. Strangely enough, MSI won't be the only company there with a gaming backpack — Zotac had the exact same idea. We're excited to check them out. (And to get a better look at them: the image above is the best render I could find; I've cleaned it up a bit, so be aware that some contours may be ever-so-slightly off.)
