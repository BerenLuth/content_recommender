Apple says LG's new 5K displays were designed for the new MacBook Pro - The Verge

If you want the greatest external monitor for the new MacBook Pro, Apple says your best bet is the new 27-inch, 5K UltraFine Display from LG. The iPhone-maker unveiled the $1,299.95 display onstage at its Mac event today, saying it had worked closely with LG to make the product a perfect match for the Pro. This may not be the new 5K Apple Cinema Display some had hoped for, but it is, apparently, the best we're going to get.
The MacBook Pro can support two LG UltraFine 5K displays, with Apple exec Phil Schiller describing the screens as the "ultimate docking station" for the MacBook. The IPS display has a 5120 x 2880 resolution, and comes with built-in cameras, microphones, and speakers, as well as three USB-C ports for extra connectivity.
A single Thunderbolt 3 cable included with the display delivers video, power, and data to your MacBook (yes, you can charge your MacBook from your monitor), and the whole thing is mounted on an adjustable stand. For more precise specs including height and weight, you can check out the display on Apple's store.
