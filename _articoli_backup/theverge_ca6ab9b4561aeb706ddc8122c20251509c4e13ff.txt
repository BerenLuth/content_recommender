Best Buy is holding midnight openings at 350 stores for the PlayStation VR - The Verge

Sony's PlayStation VR is going on sale October 13th, and for fans who need to start playing on launch day, Best Buy might be your best bet. Some 350 Best Buy stores will be holding a midnight launch on the 13th, opening their doors at 12:01AM ET. Thanks to the wonders of time zones, that means some customers will even be able to get the PlayStation VR on October 12th — starting at 9:01PM on the West Coast, 10:01PM Mountain time, and 11:01PM Central. You can find your nearest Best Buy store here.
The headset works with the PlayStation 4 only, costs $399, and will come with an eight-game demo disc. Titles on the disc include EVE: Valkyrie, Driveclub VR, and RIGS Mechanized Combat League. It's a bit of an old-school throwback to deliver these games on physical media, but Sony really has to make sure that everything goes as smoothly as possible on October 13th. Avoiding overloading the company's servers as gamers try to download demos is definitely a smart move.
