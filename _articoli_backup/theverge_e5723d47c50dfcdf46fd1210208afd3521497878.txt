DJI announces a new Osmo with a zoom lens - The Verge

DJI has just announced an update to the Osmo, the handheld version of the stabilizing gimbal and camera that the company uses on its drones. It’s called the Osmo+, and it comes with a new camera that allows for 3.5x optical zoom and up to 7x digital zoom. The new Osmo is on sale starting today for $649.
The Osmo+ uses the Zenmuse X3 Zoom camera, a version of the Zenmuse Z3 aerial camera the company announced back in July. It has the same 12.4-megapixel, 1/2.3-inch Sony Exmor R CMOS sensor as the camera on the original Osmo, and it still can shoot in 4K. The main difference is the optical zooming capability —  3.5x isn’t a lot of zoom, but it’s better than being stuck at one focal length the entire time you’re shooting. In turn, the Osmo+ has a variable aperture, which remains at f2.8 at the widest angles, but stops down to f5.2 when zoomed in.
DJI has also bumped up the battery capacity on the Osmo+. The new model has a 1,225mAh battery — a welcome step up from the 980mAh version found on the original Osmo. A more curious difference, though, is that the highest frame rate the Osmo+ can shoot is 100 frames per second, according to DJI’s official spec sheet. That’s 20 fewer than the first Osmo.
Lastly, DJI is touting a new "motion timelapse" feature on the Osmo+. This allows users to set the camera in one spot and draw out a path for the camera to trace over a specific amount of time. The resulting effect is pretty cool:
