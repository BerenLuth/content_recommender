Google's Android Wear 2.0 watches are reportedly coming early next year - The Verge

Two Google's smartwatches — first rumored in July this year — will launch in the first quarter of 2017, and will both run Android Wear 2.0. That's according to longtime leaker Evan Blass (evleaks), who tweeted the expected date alongside pictures of the supposed watches shared earlier this year by Android Police. The watches are reportedly codenamed Angelfish and Swordfish and will vary in specifications, but both will be designed around Google's AI assistant.
Blass didn't share any extra details other than the Android Wear 2.0 information and the date, but that hints at Google's plans: now that Android Wear 2.0 has been pushed back until next year, Google's two smartwatches could be among the first devices to run it. We don't know the names of the final devices, nor whether the pictures shared in July are accurate or early mockups, but if they do see the light of day in Q1 2017, they'll join Google's Pixel smartphones as part of the company's serious push back into the hardware sector with its "Made by Google" range.
