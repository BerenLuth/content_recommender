Apple may introduce three new versions of its iPad Pro next spring - The Verge
Micah Singleton
Apple is planning on releasing three new versions of its iPad Pro next spring, two in brand-new sizes, if a new report from Japanese blog Macotakara is to be believed. The report states that Apple will release a new version of its 7.9-inch iPad mini under the Pro tagline, which will feature four speakers and a smart connector just like the current lineup of iPad Pros.
Apple is also reportedly building a new 10.1-inch iPad Pro, which will feature a 12MP camera and improved True Tone flash, but those dimensions go against a report from the very reliable Apple analyst Ming Chi-Kuo, who says a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro is on the way. Macotakara also suggests the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 will receive a 12MP camera and True Tone flash as well, but offers no more details about the specs of the device.
Macotakara did say that the new iPad Pro lineup will keep the headphone jack, which would be nice. But given that this report conflicts with Ming's letter and the timeframe before these devices will supposedly be released, it's best to take this with a grain of salt, for now.
