Minecraft will get Oculus Rift support in next few weeks - The Verge
Adi Robertson
Minecraft for Windows 10 will be adding support for the Oculus Rift VR headset in the "next few weeks." Microsoft and Mojang announced the news on the one-year anniversary of Minecraft’s release on Windows 10, confirming that it will be a free update. Windows isn’t the first platform to enable Minecraft in virtual reality — that would be the Samsung Gear VR, where a VR edition of the game launched in April. But the Oculus Rift, which features things like external camera tracking, will allow for a different and possibly more comfortable experience.
We’ve tried VR versions of Minecraft on both the Rift and the Gear VR, and our impressions have varied — some of us love it, others find it disorienting. If you own an Oculus Rift, it’s worth trying simply because there aren’t that many long, complex games for the platform. There’s more information available on the Minecraft site, though we don’t know the exact release date yet.
One other, minor note: we also don’t know what’s going on with the Touch motion controller on the Minecraft VR page. We’ve only seen the game using a standard Xbox gamepad on the Rift, and it’s likely to stay that way, given how much work adding motion controls could involve. But with Oculus Connect coming up in October, anything is possible.
