Xbox One sales beat the PS4 in the US for third month in a row - The Verge
Tom Warren
Microsoft's Xbox One sales appear to be picking up in the US. Xbox One was the top-selling console in the US during July, August, and September, according to the NPD group. Microsoft still hasn't released updated console sales figures, but EA estimated Microsoft had sold 19 million Xbox Ones back in January. Nvidia recently estimated that Microsoft has reached 29 million Xbox One sales, compared to an estimate of 52 million for PS4. Sony revealed in May that it had sold more than 40 million PS4s.
The uptick in Xbox One sales in the US can be easily attributed to the recent launch of the Xbox One S console, and Microsoft's aggressive pricing for existing consoles. The software giant cut the price of the Xbox One to $249 back in July, after cutting it to $279 in June. Sony's PS4 slim debuted on September 15th, and the PSVR only just launched this week, and both are expected to boost Sony's sales. Sony is also introducing a new PS4 Pro console next month.
Microsoft's strategy might have worked for the summer months, but the real test will the upcoming important holiday sales months. If Microsoft can hold onto a lead over the busy holiday season then it would be fair to say it's turning sales around.
