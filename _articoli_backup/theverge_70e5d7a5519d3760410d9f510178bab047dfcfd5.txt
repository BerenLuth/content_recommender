Moto Z and Moto Z Force will be Daydream compatible with Android Nougat upgrade - The Verge
Ashley Carman
Lenovo is updating its modular Moto Z and Moto Z Force phones to Android Nougat starting this week. Lenovo says these will be the first official, Google-recognized Daydream-ready phones after the Pixel and Pixel XL.
The Nougat update timeline varies by carrier and country. You can check out when your phone might be upgraded here, although it seems that every carrier option, including Verizon’s, says, “This device will be upgraded to the Android 7 (Nougat) release, pending partner support.”
Currently, only Google’s Pixel phones work with the company’s Daydream VR headset. Lenovo says its Moto Z earned Google’s seal of approval based off its phone’s display, graphics performance, and sensors. Other companies, like ZTE, claim to have Daydream-ready phones, but Google only lists the Pixel as compatible. Of course, you still need to buy the Daydream headset for $79 through either Google’s online store, Best Buy, or Verizon to have any VR fun.
