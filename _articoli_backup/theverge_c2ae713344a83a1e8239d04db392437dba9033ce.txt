Oculus announces new $49 in-ear headphones for the Rift - The Verge
Dan Seifert
Oculus has announced a new way to listen to audio while immersed in the Rift virtual reality headset: a set of in-ear headphones that can be used in place of the on-ear headphones that currently come with the device. The new earbuds cost $49 and will ship in December.
Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe boasts that the earbuds sound as good as headsets that costs much more, but we'll reserve judgement on them until we're able to test that independently.
