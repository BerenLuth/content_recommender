Apple now sells refurbished iPhones - The Verge
Ashley Carman
Apple is officially selling refurbished iPhones for the first time in years in its online store, as spotted by 9to5Mac. Prices are discounted by up to 15 percent off compared to new models. A listed refurbished rose gold 64GB iPhone 6S Plus is on sale for $589, for instance, and a silver 16GB iPhone 6S Plus is $529.
Apple’s refurbished phones come with a one-year warranty — just like new iPhones — and include a new battery and outer shell. They’re also unlocked and don’t include a SIM card.
Apple already sells refurbished Macs, iPads, MacBooks, and Mac accessories, among other products, but this is the first time the company’s putting its phones up for sale. The refurbished phones might be coming from Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program. Now get out there and buy yourself a still-expensive iPhone.
Correction: We initially stated that this was the first time Apple sold refurbished iPhones in its online store. This is incorrect. Apple sold  refurbished phones in 2007, as well.  We have corrected and regret the error.
