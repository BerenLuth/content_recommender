These are some fancy iPhone corner protectors - The Verge
Ashley Carman
A company called Rmour thinks all you need to do to protect your iPhone is cover its corners. No one likes a phone case. Even if yours is exceptionally cool, like mine, you’d probably still prefer to have a regular, naked phone. The Rmour phone case for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launched on Kickstarter earlier this month and instead of covering up the entirety of your phone, it comes in four separate parts, or one for each corner. It’s essentially a broken up bumper protector.
However, unlike other bumper covers or even other corner protectors, Rmour’s product looks elegant. The covers are made of 925 sterling silver and are plated with 18K gold. They look like the page corner protectors on books that try to come off as fancy. Maybe that’s tacky, but at least your $800 phone looks more like its designers intended. I particularly like the look of Rmour’s camera lens protector.
I’m not sure these bumpers will actually keep your phone scratch or dent-free, but I guess we’ll never know until we try? A four-corners set starts at $55.
