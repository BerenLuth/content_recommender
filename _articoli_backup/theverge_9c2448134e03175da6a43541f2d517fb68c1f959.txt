After some trepidation, Steven Spielberg is dipping his big toe into virtual reality for the first time. Spielberg had previously mentioned he was working on something VR-related at Sundance this year, but didn't give many details. Now we know he's working on a project for The Virtual Reality Company, which announced today it has raised $23 million in funding for its VR studio. VRC describes Spielberg's project as "family-oriented."
Earlier this spring, Spielberg said that virtual reality could be "dangerous" to filmmakers, The Guardian reports. "I think weâ€™re moving into a dangerous medium with virtual reality," he said. "The only reason I say it is dangerous is because it gives the viewer a lot of latitude not to take direction from the storytellers but make their own choices of where to look."
It's not clear yet what role Spielberg will take in the project, or how it will be released. VRC CEO Guy Primus told The Hollywood Reporter the company is building an "online portal" for VR content. No release date has been set yet for Spielberg's project.
