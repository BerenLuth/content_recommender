Disney’s new Steam app puts its VR experiences in one place - The Verge

Disney has launched a new virtual reality app on Steam for the HTC Vive, collecting together a handful of clips and experiences from the studio's different franchises.
Reviews on Steam suggest that the free app is a bit of a mixed bag, though. There are about half a dozen pieces of content split across three films: The Jungle Book, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and Captain America: Civil War. And while the Jungle Book experiences include two immersive 3D scenes taken from the movie (like the encounter with Christopher Walken's King Louie, below), the single Civil War clip is just 360-degree footage taken from the red carpet at the film's premiere. Not the best showcase for the possibilities of VR.
In fact, the part of the app that gets the most praise from users is the lobby, where you stand in a fully-animated environment and choose between three different "parks" — Disney, Lucas, or Marvel. The movie studio could certainly do a lot more with the app in future, but right now it's just a holding pen for its various VR experiments.
