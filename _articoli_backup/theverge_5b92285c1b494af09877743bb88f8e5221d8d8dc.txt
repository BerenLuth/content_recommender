A dramatic new sound will now play for rare Xbox achievements - The Verge

Microsoft is introducing a new sound for rare Xbox One achievements. The new notification will include a special diamond icon alongside an operatic rendition of the original sound. It's designed to signal achievements that are rarely collected by fellow Xbox players, and gamers will now be able to see just how rare achievements are within each game. Microsoft is rolling the improved achievements features to Xbox One Preview members initially, and all consoles by the end of the month.
Alongside the achievement changes, Microsoft is also introducing Xbox Live Arena for competitive matches. Killer Instinct is the first supported game, allowing players to compete in daily tournaments. Microsoft is only gathering feedback about Arena so far, and the company plans to roll it out with additional features to the Xbox One Preview program later this month.
