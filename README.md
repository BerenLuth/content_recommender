# This project is made entirely by Fabio Rosada for a Web Intelligence class at Ca Foscari University

Essentially this is a content-based recommender, that downloads 1000 news from www.theverge.com (only for test) and analyze them in order to provide suggestions.

For the analysis i used Gensim libraries (https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) such as lemmatize, gensim dictionary, tf-idf and more.

With few changes it can be used for more general analysis (at the moment it is strongly related to the data structure that i downloaded from theverge).

You may find a report in the folder named "Relazione" with some helpful comments and graphics (sorry but it is in italian... also the comments in the code).
