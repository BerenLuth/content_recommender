Here's everything you can do with the new MacBook Touch Bar - The Verge
James Vincent
Apple has unveiled the new MacBook Pro and the most interesting part of it by far is the Touch Bar — a strip of touch-sensitive, context-aware display that replaces the function keys above the keyboard. Buttons on the Touch Bar change depending on the software you're using, so that when you're in your mail app, for example, it'll show you a button for deleting emails, whereas in a photo app it'll let you crop or rotate an image.
The most useful keys will stick round in most contexts (that includes brightness and volume controls on the far right, and the escape key on the far left), but the rest will change based on what you're doing, with third-party developers able to add their own functionality. There's going to be a lot you can do with the Touch Bar, but here's what we've seen so far:
And that's all we've got so far, but remember: third-party developers can also add their own functionality. We know there are custom Touch Bar buttons for Photoshop, Skype, and Office, and presumably more will follow. What's more, the Touch Bar even feels good, says our own Dieter Bohn, who had a chance to try it out today. Maybe we won't miss physical function buttons after all?
