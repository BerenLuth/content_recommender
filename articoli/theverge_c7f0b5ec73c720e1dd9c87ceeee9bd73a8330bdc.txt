iMessage users can now use Shazam without leaving their conversation - The Verge

Users of the popular music-identification app Shazam can now look up songs within iMessage without leaving their conversation. Today, the London-based company announced the launch of Shazam for iMessage, where you can send song names and previews to those you're messaging.
This is one of several initiatives that Shazam has introduced this year to attract more users. Another notable launch was their integration with Google Play Music. This feature lets Google Play Music users listen, buy, or start a radio station on the last song identified with Shazam. Last week, Shazam released a "lite" version of its app to emerging market users including those in India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Venezuela, and Nigeria.
Earlier this year, the company also made attempts to get into music distribution. Mick Management, an artist management firm, partnered with Sony's RCA Records to ship postcards to Ray LaMontagne fans prior to the release of his album Ouroboros. Fans were able to get access to an exclusive song when they directed their phone camera at the postcard, with Shazam open.
Shazam for iMessage is available to download for free from the iMessage App Store.
