Microsoft announces Paint 3D, the biggest update ever to the classic app - The Verge
Ashley Carman
Microsoft is releasing a revamped and modernized Paint app for Windows 10 that makes creating in 3D easy. The company announced the app at its keynote today where it stressed the future of creating in 3D. Users can take photos and turn portions of the photo into 3D objects, or turn a 2D doodle into a 3D image. All the 2D pens and pencils also work on any 3D object. Stickers can be stamped onto 2D images to to make it 3D. Microsoft envisions these creations will be viewed on the HoloLens.
Along with the app, users can also share work in a new online community that comes with a focus on Minecraft. People can directly export from the game and 3D print whatever they make. The new version of the Paint app was put online earlier this month and available for anyone to download.
Paint 3D stays true to the classic app in that it's a basic editing and creating app but with some noted 21st-century 3D pizzaz.
