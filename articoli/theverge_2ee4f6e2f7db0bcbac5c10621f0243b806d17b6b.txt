Windows 10’s next major update to debut in March - The Verge

Microsoft is planning at least two major updates to Windows 10 next year, and the first (codenamed Redstone 2) will likely arrive in March. Twitter user WalkingCat has discovered several references to "Windows 10 Version 1703" in the latest test versions of Microsoft's operating system. These references refer to the year and month of a release, and Microsoft has previously used the same codes for its Anniversary Update (1607) released in July, and a November update (1511) last year.
Microsoft is expected to detail what the company is planning to include in its next major Windows 10 update at a special Surface PC event later this month. While Microsoft has started testing some new features of Windows 10 with Windows Insiders, most of the changes have been fairly minor so far. Microsoft is planning to bring a blue light reduction feature to Windows 10, alongside improvements to Cortana to help bridge the gap between mobile devices and PCs.
Microsoft is also planning a "HomeHub" feature for Windows 10 to manage smart devices, and it's possible this might make it into the update scheduled for March. The Verge will be reporting live from Microsoft's Windows 10 event on October 26th, so stay tuned for more information.
