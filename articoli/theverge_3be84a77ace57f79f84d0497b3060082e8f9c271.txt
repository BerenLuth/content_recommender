Periscope will let you broadcast directly to your biggest fans - The Verge

Periscope may have helped jumpstart the live video trend, but until now it’s been difficult to specify which audience direct your content toward without blindly going live for everyone to see, or manually inviting users to a particular stream. Today’s update will give you a more informed look at who to share your broadcast with and creating Groups to accommodate that.
If you’re looking to target your biggest followers, Periscope now shows you a list of “Superfans,” or 10 of your most engaged viewers based on whether they follow your account, and how often they watch and comment on your videos You can even see a ranking of your Superfans from numbers one to 10.
In addition to seeing who their Superfans are, you can also see which account has you as their Superfan... so don’t get creepy, because Periscope knows.
Building from this, Periscope now lets you create your own Groups so you can reach communities with specific interests, such as your online fans, Superfans, or in-real-life friends. The idea is you can broadcast directly to a group of your most loyal followers to build relationships with them or share something exclusively to a specific subset. For reporters and bloggers, that’ll be helpful to cut down feed clutter between work-related broadcasts and personal ones.
Periscope is also adding a small update to its web viewer with the ability to browse suggested through videos and comment or send hearts. Previously, you were only able to watch the streams.
The Superfan and Group update is live now on both Android and iOS.
