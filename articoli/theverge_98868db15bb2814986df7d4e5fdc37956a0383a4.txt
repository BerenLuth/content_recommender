A Rick and Morty VR game is coming to the HTC Vive - The Verge
Sean O'Kane
Wubba lubba dub dub! Owlchemy labs, the makers of Job Simulator — one of the most bizarre and truly fun games in the early days of virtual reality — announced today that they’ll soon be releasing a new VR game for the HTC Vive based on Rick and Morty. Neither Owlchemy nor showrunners Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon have said when it will officially be released, but they’ll be offering demos of Rick and Morty Simulator: Virtual Rick-ality next week at San Diego Comic-Con.
Adult Swim — which airs the show — posted a 15-second teaser this afternoon that, while upsettingly brief, makes me want to jump into a headset and play right away nonetheless. As is typical with all things Rick and Morty, the brevity doesn’t mean there’s not a ton of attention to detail. Rick’s lab (aka Jerry’s garage) looks like it’s been faithfully recreated right down to little details like the box of "Time Travel Stuff" and Krombopulos Michael’s business card.
As for what the actual game will be like, Owlchemy labs is light on details at the moment. "We’ve been working in secret for months, optimizing plumbus physics and working on the intricacies of Rick’s flask," they write. "Now we’re ready to give you all a hint of what’s to come! (Spoiler alert: you can totally jump through portals in VR!)."
Fans of the series know that the possibilities could be endless. Who knows? Maybe you’ll be able to freeze time. Maybe you’ll be able to visit Blips and Chitz and play Roy: A Life Well Lived. (How meta.) Or maybe it will just be a 20-minute explanation of the Gear Wars.
