Qualcomm is trying to put dual cameras in more phones - The Verge

Dual cameras are on their way to becoming a smartphone staple, and Qualcomm wants to help that happen. It’s developed a dual-camera package that manufacturers can add to their phones and tablets, so long as they’re running on a Snapdragon 820 or 821 processor. The intention is to make it simpler for manufacturers to add a dual-camera setup to their phone, since Qualcomm has already handled most of the development.
Qualcomm’s dual camera system, called Clear Sight, works quite a bit differently than the iPhone 7 Plus’ dual setup. Rather than using the second camera to offer enhanced zooming, Qualcomm’s second camera is meant to enhance image quality, particularly when it comes to low light.
The Clear Sight system does that by pairing a standard color sensor with a black-and-white sensor, which is capable of capturing more detail. By combing its additional detail with the color gathered from the color sensor, the dual camera can theoretically produce a sharper photo. It’s exactly like what Huawei did on the P9 — you can go here for more detail on how it works.
This isn’t the first time Qualcomm has tried to deploy dual-camera systems to other phones. Last October, it detailed its processors’ support for dual camera systems with refocusing capabilities. Of course, as is evident by the phones available today, that hasn’t exactly led to the proliferation of dual-camera systems. But they have been growing more common over the past year thanks to LG and Huawei. With Apple’s new addition to the iPhone 7 Plus, it’s likely that interest will continue to grow.
