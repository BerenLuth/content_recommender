The Sonos Play:1 speaker is $50 off for Black Friday - The Verge
Chaim Gartenberg
The Play:1 is the entry-level gateway speaker from Sonos, and this weekend it’s on sale for $149 — $50 off the usual price — at a variety of retailers, including Amazon, Sonos, Best Buy, and the Apple Store. And despite being at the lower end of the Sonos product line, the Play:1 is still a fantastic speaker, whether used on its own or in a multi-room setup.
Sonos has bundled two Play:1s together for $349 in the past, but this individual $50 discount is one of the best prices we’ve seen on the speaker. It’s a good deal, especially for a Sonos product given that the speakers rarely go on sale. So if you’re looking for a single-room speaker or just want to build out your Sonos system, now's a good time. Sonos’ Black Friday sale will run from November 24th through November 28th.
