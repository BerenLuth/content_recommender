Super Mario’s long-awaited mobile debut is coming very soon: Nintendo has announced that Super Mario Run will be launching on December 15th for iOS devices. The game will feature three different modes, each of which you can try out for free. But in order to get the complete experience you’ll need to pay a one-time fee of $9.99. Nintendo says that the game will be available in 151 countries at launch, and will support multiple languages, including English, Japanese, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Russian, and traditional Chinese. The game was first announced in September, when Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto appeared onstage at an Apple event. You can get an idea of how the new game plays in the just-launched trailer above.
