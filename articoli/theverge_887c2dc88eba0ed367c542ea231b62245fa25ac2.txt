PlayStation 4 will be on sale for $250 from December 11th to December 24th - The Verge
Chaim Gartenberg
Sony announced that it's offering the Uncharted 4 PlayStation 4 Slim bundle for $249.99 — $50 off its usual $299.99 price tag — from December 11th through December 24th. So if you missed out on buying a PlayStation 4 during the Black Friday / Cyber Monday deals, there's still time to pick one up at a lower price than usual.
Sony hasn't said which retailers will offer the deal, but it's safe to assume that the usual suspects of Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and GameStop (among others) are good places to check. So whether you need to pick up a last-minute present or are looking to get in on a PlayStation 4 after Sony's big announcements at PlayStation Experience last week, it couldn't hurt to wait until Sunday.
