Google discounts Chromecast, Pixel, and Google Home for Black Friday 2016 - The Verge
Nick Statt
Google is well on its way from being a company synonymous with search and the web to a brand name well known for its hardware products. We’re all familiar with the Chromecast name; the streaming stick has been Google’s Trojan horse into the living room, selling millions of units and establishing the search giant’s software as a viable media nexus. Now, there’s the Google Home smart speaker to compete with Amazon’s Echo, as well the company’s new flagship Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones.
All of these products are on sale for Black Friday this week, and you can pick them up on discount from a number of different retailers. Verizon is only the authorized Pixel and Pixel XL seller in the US, besides the Play Store. So phone deals are contingent on joining Verizon’s network, or already being a part of it. For Home and Chromecast, you’ll be able to shop around at a few different places.
Here’s where to start when it comes to picking up Google gadgets starting tomorrow. And be sure to check out our other deal roundups at The Verge’s Black Friday hub.
