Stop enabling Michael Bay with insane 8K cameras - The Verge
Ashley Carman
We’ve got four Transformers already produced and one in the works for next year, which makes me wonder, when will the madness end? Can Michael Bay ever be stopped? Apparently not as the new Transformers: The Last Knight  is only the beginning of a new era of filmmaking for the Bay because he now has a custom-built 8K sensor camera to play with. Both the CEO and chief design officer at RED Digital Cinema unveiled their new RED Helium 8K super 35mm sensor camera on Instagram this past week. They use a lot of #bayhem hashtags.

There aren’t many details on the camera itself, but CEO Jarred Land confirmed that it uses a new 3.65 micron sensor line. When RED created a custom camera for David Fincher earlier this year, it didn't release it to the public, so it's possible this new 8K camera might be Bay-only. Cinema5D did report that the new sensor will eventually be available as an upgrade to existing RED cameras, although it doesn't mention the camera body as a consumer option.
Bay isn't the only guy who gets to play with 8K filming; this year's Rio Olympics will be partially filmed in 8K "Super-Hi Vision." Good luck finding an 8K TV to watch the games on, though.
