You can now spend money on the first iPhone 7 headphone jack case - The Verge

When Apple removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, it was not a question of if, but rather when, an onrush of cases with built-in 3.5mm headphone jacks would be flooding crowdfunding sites and stores.

And so, a mere 22 days after the iPhone 7’s announcement, we already have the first such case, the Fuze. As the extremely enthusiastic announcement video explains, the Fuze case is a battery pack case that brings back the "rock and roll" choice of a 3.5mm headphone jack to your device. The case itself contains either a 2,400 mAh (iPhone 7), or 3,600 mAh (iPhone 7 Plus) battery for extra power, and conveniently charges via Lightning cable instead of Micro USB.
While others have beaten Fuze to the punch at the concept of a headphone jack case, Fuze appears to be the first to allow you to actually spend your hard-earned money at the promise of receiving a battery case with a headphone jack from a crowdfunding company that has no previous experience shipping hardware. If you are willing to take the risk, the Fuze case starts at $50 over at Indiegogo. The company hopes to ship the first early-bird batch before the end of December.
