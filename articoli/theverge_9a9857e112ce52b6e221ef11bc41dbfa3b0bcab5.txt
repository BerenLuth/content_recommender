Apple is reducing the price of its new 5K LG UltraFine Display by more than 25 percent as part of an effort to ease the transition to its new line of MacBook Pros. The special promotion, which amounts to a $349 price cut for the $1,299.95 monitor, brings the product’s price under $1,000. The company is also reducing the price on the 4K version from $699.95 to $524. Both products, designed in partnership between Apple and LG, are available on Apple’s online store, with the 4K model available now and the 5K model going on sale next month.
In addition to these display promotions, Apple is temporarily reducing the cost of its many USB-C adapters now that the new MacBook Pro only contains Thunderbolt 3 ports. In a statement, the company said it recognized that many professionals rely on legacy ports and older devices, and that the price cuts would stay in effect until the end of the year.
“We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem,” Apple said. “Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables.”
