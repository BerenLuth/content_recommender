Chinese tech company LeEco had its US launch last month, with most of its products available online via its LeMall website. This week, however, you’ll be able to buy them from US-based retailers, including Best Buy, Target, and Amazon.
TechCrunch reports that LeEco will begin selling its smartphones and televisions via third-party sellers starting December 1st. This includes the $399 LePro 3 smartphone, which received LePositive reviews by Lauren Goode for its looks, speedy software, and competitive pricing. (Note that the products will be sold online only, they’re not yet available in stores.)
Though LeEco products will be available through those third-party retailers, the company is incentivizing customers to buy directly from LeMall by offering rebate deals ranging from $80 to $200. Buyers are also eligible for a free subscription to DirecTV Now if they buy a TV or phone from LeMall before January 5th.
