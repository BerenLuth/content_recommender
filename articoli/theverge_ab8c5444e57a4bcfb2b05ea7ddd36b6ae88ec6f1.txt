Jony Ive and Marc Newson’s latest collaboration is a Christmas tree - The Verge

Apple’s chief design officer Jony Ive and and industrial designer Marc Newson are designing a new, exclusive project in time for the holidays: a Christmas tree.
The tree is part of London hotel Claridge’s seasonal celebration, the hotel announced on its website. Since 2009, different designers have created a unique tree to commemorate the holidays. Ive and Newson’s work will be unveiled on November 18; the two join previous designers such as Dolce & Gabbana, McQueens’ Kally Ellis, and Christopher Bailey of Burberry.
Ive has played a major role at Apple over the last two decades, but more recently has taken a step back and occasionally worked on odd, outside projects with Newson. Their past work includes a one-off desk and a one-off Leica camera for charity.
