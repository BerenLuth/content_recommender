Now only the Supreme Court can overturn Samsung’s $120 million Apple patent dispute - The Verge

A years-long patent dispute between Samsung and Apple might finally be coming to a close. This week, a federal appeals court denied Samsung’s request for a rehearing on a decision that it infringed on two Apple patents, effectively closing the case unless the Supreme Court is willing to hear it. So right now, Samsung still owes Apple nearly $120 million.
In 2014, a jury in San Jose, California found that Samsung infringed on Apple’s quick links patent, which turns addresses and phone numbers into links, as well as the company’s swipe to unlock patent. During the trial, Apple was also ordered to pay $158,400 for infringing on a Samsung patent covering a photo and video gallery feature.
Samsung’s verdict was overturned once, then reinstated again earlier this year. Apple’s $158,400 has also been maintained. A separate Samsung / Apple patent case is currently being deliberated by the Supreme Court and is expected to have a decision by June 2017. So settle in because this definitely isn’t the last time we’ll be hearing about a patent dispute between the two companies.
