How tech rivals will respond to Google - The Verge
Andrew Marino
In our first podcast after Tuesday’s Google event, Ctrl-Walt-Delete looks at new products from Google that blend together hardware, software, and ecosystem design. Walt and Nilay sit down to discuss how this makes Google a great competitor for companies like Apple, Amazon, Samsung, and Microsoft.
We love your feedback on the topics of the show and suggestions on how to make our show better and more fun — you can tweet at Walt at @waltmossberg and Nilay at @reckless. And of course, we'd love it if you subscribed in iTunes (here's the direct RSS feed, if you like), along with The Verge's other great podcasts like What's Tech, and The Vergecast.
