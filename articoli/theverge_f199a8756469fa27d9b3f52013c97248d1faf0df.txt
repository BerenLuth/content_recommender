Samsung's top phones come with a free Gear VR for the next two weeks - The Verge
Jacob Kastrenakes
Samsung is trying to get the Gear VR around even more people's heads. For just over the next two weeks, through June 19th, Samsung will include a Gear VR for free with all sales of the Galaxy S7, S7 Edge, S6, S6 Edge and Edge+, and Galaxy Note 5. It'll also come with six games from the Oculus store.
This is the same deal that was available to anyone preordering the S7 and S7 Edge earlier this year. But now the bundle is opening up to even more phones, including some older models. The Gear VR is the closest thing to the Galaxy line has to a must-have accessory — it's a relatively cheap and accessible starting point for VR content and gaming — so offering it bundled with Samsung's latest phones is a pretty appealing deal.
To take advantage of the deal, you have to buy the phone first and then register for the promotion at Samsung's website.
