Microsoft to launch new Surface PC at October 26th event - The Verge

Microsoft is holding a special Windows 10 and Surface event in New York City later this month. The software giant has started emailing out invites to an event on October 26th, and Microsoft is expected to make some Xbox-related announcements at the event, alongside new Surface hardware and some details on the company's next Windows 10 software update. Microsoft's event isn't expected to be as large, or involve as much hardware, as its huge amount of announcements last year.
Surface-branded keyboards and a mouse have started leaking ahead of Microsoft's event, and the company is widely expected to be unveiling at least one new all-in-one desktop PC. Sources familiar with Microsoft's plans tell The Verge that the company isn't planning to refresh its Surface Pro 4 or Surface Book devices at the event, and will showcase laptops and devices from OEMs instead.
The main focus of the event will be the unveiling of Microsoft's vision for the future of Windows 10, and the company's desktop PC hardware to support it. Microsoft is expected to detail new features in Windows 10 that it plans to ship in two major software updates next year, and discuss how some of those features feed into its Xbox gaming strategy across both platforms. The Verge will be live from Microsoft's event in New York City on October 26th, so stay tuned for our live blog.
