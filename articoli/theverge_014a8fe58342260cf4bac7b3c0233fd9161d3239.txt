Outfit your entire family with 360-degree cameras - The Verge
Ashley Carman
Chinese company Insta360 introduced four 360-degree cameras at IFA this week. There’s one for everyone.
The Insta360 Stereo takes "hemispherical 3D photos and videos" and supports live streaming. This is good for your friend who loves Facebook Live.
The Pro-Professional 360-degree camera is for pros. I have no other details, so this is for your truly professional friends.
The Insta360 Air is an Android HD camera that shoots and streams "HD VR and panoramic stills and videos." This sounds good for someone who is passionate about their Android phone.
The Insta360 4K is a 4k camera with two ultra-wide angle fisheye lenses. This is for the extreme sports person in your life who knows everyone only wants to watch fish eye videos.
Insta360 didn’t give us much of an idea on how these cameras work or their price. But if we want to use the company's already-released Insta360 Nano as a reference, these cameras will likely be decently affordable. The Nano, which plugs into iPhone’s Lightning port, costs only $219.
