Apple's $1,499 13-inch MacBook Pro has an escape key, but no Touch Bar - The Verge
Chris Welch
Alongside the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, Apple just introduced a third new MacBook Pro model that's something of an unofficial successor to the MacBook Air. It slots in as a cheaper option next to the 15-inch and 13-inch Touch Bar models.  The company plans to continue selling its 13-inch Air, Phil Schiller said, but this specific MacBook Pro will likely be a preferable option for those who can afford its $1,499 price. (The 13-inch Air remains priced at $999.) It's 13 percent smaller in volume than the existing Air and weighs the same 3 pounds. It retains traditional, physical function keys — yes, like escape — so there's no Touch Bar on this version.
But the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro does get some of the same upgraded hardware found in its pricier counterparts like Thunderbolt 3 (two ports), faster Intel processors, and improved second-generation butterfly keyboard. Unfortunately, like the other models, it also loses the SD card slot. Storage comes as 256GB by default but can be upgraded to either 512GB or 1TB.
The screen is a Retina display, which alone may be enough to convince many consumers to step up from the Air. Rumors before today's event had suggested Apple might update the Air with USB-C ports and faster internals, but instead, Phil Schiller spent several minutes explaining all the ways in which this cheaper 13-inch Pro is such a superior machine. It begins shipping immediately, whereas the Touch Bar MacBook Pros won't launch for two to three weeks.
At this stage, the MacBook Air remains in Apple's lineup mostly for its alluring, low $999 price point. Its all-day battery life is also a big plus compared to the iffy longevity of the MacBooks Pro. It's Apple's most inexpensive and long-lasting laptop, but no longer anywhere close to the company's best.
