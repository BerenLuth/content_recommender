Apple’s next iPhone could have a curved screen - The Verge

Apple’s 2017 iPhone lineup might include a model with a curved screen similar to Samsung’s Edge devices, according to a new Wall Street Journal report. Apple’s suppliers told the paper that they were asked to “increase output of thinner organic light emitting displays and submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from Samsung.”
But with that in mind, the company is also reportedly considering more than 10 prototypes, so a curved display might not make it to market.
We’ve heard this rumor before when it was coupled with the idea that at least one of  Apple’s new phones would include an OLED display. We’ve also heard that the 2017 iPhone lineup will include three devices: two 5.5-inch models differentiated by their displays, and a 4.7-inch model. The larger models may include dual cameras.
