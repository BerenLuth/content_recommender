Pornhub, one of the largest porn sites online, has just launched a new section devoted to VR porn. The company is partnering with virtual porn purveyors BaDoinkVR to showcase premium VR content for the site's 60 million daily visitors.
"Virtual reality is the next phase in the constantly metamorphosing world of adult entertainment, and will provide users with a mesmeric experience unlike anything they’ve seen before," said Pornhub VP Corey Price in a statement. "Now, our users are not only able to view our content, but be protagonists in the experience and interact with their favorite porn stars."

With this launch, Pornhub is now providing both 180-degree and 360-degree VR scenes on its site for free. The content can be viewed on the desktop, but will most optimally be viewed with Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear VR, and Oculus Rift. The site is even giving away 10,000 Cardboard goggles to users to celebrate the launch.
As anyone can glean from the site's enthusiastic (if eye-roll inducing) launch ad, Pornhub is clearly excited about VR's potential for revolutionizing pornography. Indeed, BaDoinkVR is among a growing number of companies that have been making VR content for some time. That one of the single biggest porn repositories on the internet is devoting a whole section to the burgeoning format speaks to the industry seeing its future in it. As performer and VRTube.XXX founder Ela Darling told The Verge last year, the allure is the promise of immersion. "You can look around, you can see the environment that you’re in, you can see what’s around you," she said. "That immersion is the biggest factor."
