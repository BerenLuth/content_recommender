Microsoft isn't afraid of Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro - The Verge
Tom Warren
Sony unveiled its next big iteration of the PlayStation 4 last night. Dubbed PlayStation 4 Pro, the new console includes a faster processor, better graphics, and support for 4K resolution. It comes just months after Microsoft surprisingly unveiled its Project Scorpio console, a successor to the Xbox One that's capable of running 4K-native games.
While Sony's new console will debut next month, Microsoft's Xbox One upgrade won't arrive until the end of next year. Despite this, Microsoft doesn't appear to be afraid of Sony's new PlayStation 4 Pro. "I feel pretty good about the decisions we've made," says Albert Penello, director of product management and planning at Xbox, in an interview with Polygon. "Both we and Sony are investing in 4K as the future of the console space, and we have a history of adding features to our hardware."
Microsoft seems confident its console will be a lot more powerful than Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro. Microsoft is targeting a GPU clocked at 6 teraflops, which will be 43 percent more powerful than the PlayStation 4 Pro on paper at least. "The performance delta will be obvious," says Penello. All of this performance might sound intriguing, but Sony now has a head start and a year to improve on its already impressive PS4 sales.
Microsoft might not be concerned about Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro just yet, but if it helps widen the sales gap even further over the holidays and beyond then we might just start hearing more about Project Scorpio a lot sooner than Microsoft was hoping.
