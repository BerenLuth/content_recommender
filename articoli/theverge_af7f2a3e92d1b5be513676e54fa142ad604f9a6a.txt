Apple is now selling unlocked iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets in the US - The Verge

Apple is now selling unlocked iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones in the United States. The SIM-free versions of the latest models will work with any US network, Apple says, with prices starting at $649 for the iPhone 7, and $769 for the larger iPhone 7 Plus. The unlocked devices come in the full range of iPhone 7 colors and storage capacities, but are only available from Apple's online store at the moment, and there's no option for in-store pickup yet.
Device stocks appear to be low, too, with delivery expectations of three to four weeks for most models, and six to eight weeks for the jet black version. That should improve with time, however, as the unlocked phones are also likely to filter into Apple's retail stores. The iPhone 7 was released about a month ago, but American customers have been forced to wait for an unlocked model — SIM-free versions of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have been available from Apple's online store in the UK, Canada, and Australia for a few weeks now.
