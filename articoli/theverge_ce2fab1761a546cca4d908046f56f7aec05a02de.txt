HP updates its Spectre x360 with an edge-to-edge screen and bigger battery - The Verge

HP is announcing updates to its premium consumer laptops today, including the popular Spectre x360 and the powerful Envy 13. Both laptops gain larger batteries and design updates, while the x360 gets an overhaul that includes a smaller footprint and a new edge-to-edge display. In addition, HP is updating its Envy all-in-one with a refreshed design and Intel’s latest processors.
The new Spectre x360 maintains the outgoing version’s ability to rotate the display behind the keyboard, but it has a narrower design thanks to its edge-to-edge display. The new model is a full 11.8mm narrower than before and now has a quad speaker array. HP says the Spectre x360 can now last for up to 15 hours between charges, a 25 percent improvement, thanks to its larger battery and better efficiencies throughout the system. It also has the ability to recharge its battery up to 90 percent in 90 minutes. The Spectre x360 can be outfitted with a seventh-generation Core i5 or Core i7 processor, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to a 1TB SSD. It will be available starting this month for $1,159 and up.
The new Envy 13 isn’t as svelte as the Spectre, but it’s not as expensive either. It is made of aluminum and magnesium and can be outfitted with a full-HD or quad-HD display, with the latter also available as a touchscreen. HP says it fitted a 28 percent larger battery in the new Envy, which gives it up to 14 hours of battery life. (It also has the ability to charge up to 90 percent in 90 minutes.) The Envy 13 will also be available with seventh-generation Core i5 and i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. It will start at $849 when it is available later this month.
Over in the desktop world, HP’s new Envy all-in-one has a 27-inch quad-HD IPS touchscreen (HP says a 4K option is coming later), 9.5mm bezel on the top and sides, and pedestal design with the computer in the base and the monitor suspended above. It has Intel’s latest Core i5 or i7 processors and can be had with an optional Nvidia GTX950M graphics card. HP will be selling the Envy all-in-one this month starting at $1,249.
Finally, HP is also updating its Envy Display, a 27-inch 4K monitor. It features an IPS panel with 178 degree viewing angle and 99 percent sRGB color gamut. For ports, it has dual HDMI, dual Display Ports, and a USB-C port for peripherals. HP says the Envy Display will be out this December for $499.
