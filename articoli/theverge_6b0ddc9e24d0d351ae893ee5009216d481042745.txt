Björk's latest album is getting a VR makeover - The Verge
Rich McCormick
Björk has long used textured soundscapes to evoke the wilderness of her native Iceland, but the pop pioneer is now going one better — taking listeners to a virtual version of the country using VR headsets. The Björk Digital tour will travel the world over the coming months, allowing fans to don HTC Vive and Samsung Gear VR headsets to visit Icelandic fields, beaches, and caves, all set to tracks from Vulnicura, Björk's most recent album.
In addition to the 360-degree video for "Stonemilker," first released last year, attendees will be able to catch the videos for "Black Lake," "Mouth Mantra," and the world premiere of "Notget" in virtual reality. HTC says the video for this last track "combines high resolution 3D scans, on-location holostudio, motion capture and videogrammetry along with real-time special audio design," allowing users to walk around inside streams of particles and light in the Vive's virtual space.
In addition to these four tracks, attendees will be able to access a 'Biophilia' app room and wander through visual art installations when the Björk Digital tour starts in Sydney tomorrow, with five more tracks being given the VR treatment over the coming months as the experience moves on to Tokyo, London, Paris, and other major cities across the globe. If you can't make it to one of the shows but have your own VR headset, Variety says the tour's videos will eventually be made downloadable so you can explore windswept Iceland while the country's most famous star serenades you in the comfort of your own home.
