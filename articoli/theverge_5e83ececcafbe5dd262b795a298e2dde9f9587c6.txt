Rogue One Q&A and 'never before seen content' will air live on Twitter later this week - The Verge

With a little more than two weeks left before Rogue One: A Star Wars Story hits theaters, Twitter has hopped onto the film’s promotional bandwagon. Recode reports that Twitter and Disney have announced plans to live stream a Q&A with the movie’s cast, including Felicity Jones and Diego Luna, later this week from a “surprise location,” as well as “never before seen content” from the movie.
The stream will air for an hour starting this Friday at 1PM ET. It’s not clear what content the two companies will show off, but the stream will be available to fans with and without Twitter accounts online and on the official Twitter apps for Apple TV, Fire TV, and Xbox.
It’s not clear how long the content streaming on Friday will be exclusive to Twitter before it lands on other platforms. However, this move fits easily into the social company’s streaming content ambitions. The NFL already has a deal with Twitter to stream games across multiple devices, and startup Cheddar partnered with the company to stream daily financial news programs. In the end, this is a nice early Christmas gift for Star Wars fans.
Rogue One hits theaters on December 16th. Tickets are on sale now.
