Sony announces limited Final Fantasy XV Walkman, headphones, and speaker for Japan - The Verge
Sam Byford
After over a decade of on-off development, Final Fantasy XV is finally landing on a console near you tomorrow. (Stay tuned: our review is coming later today.) And what better way to celebrate than a limited edition Sony Walkman? No better way, that’s what.
Thankfully, Sony is releasing the Walkman A-Series Final Fantasy XV Edition in Japan tomorrow starting at 33,880 yen ($300-ish) for a 16GB model. It supports Hi-Res Audio and comes with little pixel-art Final Fantasy characters on the back.
Also, it has “special icons” only to be found on this Final Fantasy model. You can see the dramatic difference when compared to the boring, regular Walkman software here:
Yeah, us either.
Sony is also releasing Final Fantasy XV-branded 24,380 yen ($220) hear.on MDR-100A headphones and a 29,380 yen ($260) hear.go SRS-HG1 Bluetooth speaker tomorrow, both of which you can see below. All of these products are likely to remain eternally exclusive to Sony Stores across Japan, unfortunately.
