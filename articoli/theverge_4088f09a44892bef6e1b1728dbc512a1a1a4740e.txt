Google's Pixel phones will be available through Project Fi - The Verge
Chris Welch
Just as it did with its Nexus smartphones, Google will sell itsÂ brand-new Pixel and Pixel XL via the company's Project Fi mobile network. So although Verizon is the exclusive carrier partner, you'll still be able to buy the phone unlocked (or with monthly installments) starting at $649. Monthly payments start at $27/month. The Pixels fully support Fi's network switching between T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular.
Project Fi costs $20 per month for unlimited calls and texts, plus $10 for each gigabyte of data. Google also credits customers back each month for any data they've paid for and not fully used. Whether Fi is financially advantageous versus traditional carrier plans depends on how much mobile data you use month to month. Customer service is handled directly through Google and the Project Fi app.
