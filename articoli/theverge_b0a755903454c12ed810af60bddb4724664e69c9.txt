Apple’s World AIDS Day push includes new products and App Store specials - The Verge

Apple is turning its attention and resources back to a decade-long partnership with the Product (RED) campaign today. The company has kicked off an effort meant to coincide with Thursday’s World AIDS Day and is introducing several new products, special limited-edition items for games in the App Store, and donations tied to certain Apple Pay purchases — all intended to nudge customers to join the fight against AIDS.
At a small press gathering in New York City on Tuesday, Apple VP Lisa Jackson said "We’ve been part of (RED) from the beginning," adding that the partnership "really aligns with who we are as a company." The campaign, which includes other partners such as Starbucks, Coca-Cola, and Bank of America, has raised over $360 million and directed that money to the Global Fund to fight AIDS. Apple points out that it (plus Beats) has raised nearly $120 million of that total, making it the largest corporate Global Fund contributor in the world.
But the company wants that number to grow much larger, with the goal being to reach the first "AIDS-free generation" by ending pediatric AIDS perhaps as soon as 2020. So, as Jackson said Tuesday, "essentially, Apple is turning (RED)" for the next two days in the following ways:
Apple retail: The company says 400 stores across five continents will either turn the Apple emblem red or display window signage related to World AIDS Day and (RED).
App Store: 20 popular games will release exclusive in-app purchases of (RED) content, and 100 percent of those proceeds will go to the Global Fund.
New products: Apple has unveiled a (RED) smart battery case for iPhone 7, a (RED) Beats Pill+, (RED) Beats Solo 3 headphones, and a (RED) leather case for the iPhone SE as the latest additions to its lineup of products linked to the campaign.
Donations for Apple Pay purchases: Beginning today, Apple will donate $1 to (RED) "for every purchase made with Apple Pay" via the company’s website or at the Apple Store for a total of up to $1 million. Bank of America has also agreed to make a donation for every Apple Pay transaction using its cards, up to the same $1 million maximum. That one seems a little more likely to raise the $1 million a little faster, if you ask me.
