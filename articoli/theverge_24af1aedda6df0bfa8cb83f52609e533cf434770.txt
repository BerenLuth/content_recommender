Samsung's Gear 360 VR camera launches in the US for $349.99, sort of - The Verge

Samsung's Gear 360, the spherical video camera first shown off at Mobile World Congress in February, is finally landing in the US. Samsung has set the price at $349.99, but there's a catch — you can only buy it "on a limited basis" at VidCon, which kicks off in Anaheim tomorrow. If you can't make it down there, you'll have to wait for details of a wider launch to come later in the year.
Samsung is also using VidCon as a springboard to launch new VR and 360-degree content offerings. Milk VR has been renamed to Samsung VR and now supports user-generated content; creators can upload 360-degree videos for viewing on the Gear VR headset.
In addition, a new initiative called Samsung Creators will see the company partner with video shooters and curate content for the platform. Samsung is working with noted YouTuber Casey Neistat to "spotlight emerging creators from YouTube and push the creative boundaries of 360 video storytelling," and will launch a competition next month to pick 10 winners who've made VR content using Samsung products.
