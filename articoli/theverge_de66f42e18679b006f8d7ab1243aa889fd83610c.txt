Now you can be a cat and knock things over in VR - The Verge
T.C. Sottek
Everyone's favorite cat destruction simulator, Catlateral Damage, is now available for virtual reality on the HTC Vive. The VR version of the game turns you into a cat ghost that can warp around and materialize wherever the most damage can be inflicted on a human domicile. And then you knock things over. Yeah, it's kinda just like the existential object-flinger Job Simulator — except in this game you're a cat! Everybody wins.
The VR version of Catlateral Damage is available as a free update to the game on Steam, and you can get the full game for $4.99 through the end of the month. Note: as you can see in the trailer above, the game is best experienced when you tape cat ears to the top of your Vive headset. We'll be making some "modifications" to our own equipment as soon as we get back to the office.
