Microsoft to unveil Surface all-in-one PC in late October - The Verge

Microsoft has been testing a variety of Surface all-in-one PCs, and the company is expected to unveil at least one model during a hardware event next month. ZDNet reports that Microsoft will unveil a Surface-branded device currently codenamed "Cardinal" at an event in New York City. Sources familiar with Microsoft's Surface plans tell The Verge that the company is currently targeting a late October hardware launch event.
Previous reports have suggested that Microsoft is working on three Surface-branded all-in-one PCs that will be available in stores later this year. Windows Central previously reported that Microsoft has tested 21-inch, 24-inch, and 27-inch models, but it's not clear if the software maker will launch all three screen sizes. Microsoft hinted back in July that it was planning to launch a new Surface-branded device this year, and three more for next year. Microsoft could also use its event to refresh its Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 devices with Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors, but the company is likely to wait until next year to unveil true successors.
Microsoft is also planning two major software updates to Windows 10 next year, with the first expected to debut alongside new hardware in early 2017.
