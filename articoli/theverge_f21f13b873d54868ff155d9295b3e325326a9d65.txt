Apple’s top picks for the year include Deadpool, Drake, Prisma, and Plants vs. Zombies - The Verge

If you’re looking for some distractions over the coming Christmas holiday, you could do  a lot worse than checking out Apple’s annual best-of lists. Each year the company names its favorite apps, games, music, movies, and more. This year’s top pick in the category is AI-powered art filter Prisma, with Supercell’s card-based battler Clash Royale taking best game. (Pokémon Go gets a nod as “breakout hit” of the year, but nothing more than that — perhaps it wasn’t polished enough for Apple’s liking.)
As well as apps and games, Apple also selected best movies, books, and more. The company picked “One Dance” by Drake as its song of the year, and the album that single came from (Views, by Drake, too, obviously) as its best album.
Now, this isn’t an undeserved pick (Drake was also Spotify’s most streamed artist this year, and his influence on pop culture in 2016 has been massive), but it’s worth pointing out that Apple has a long-standing relationship with the rapper. They’ve reportedly signed promotional deals together, and Drake has been one of the most visible spokespeople for Apple Music. Undoubtedly, Apple benefits when it promotes Drake, and vice versa.
Apple also picked a whole bunch of other favorite albums, including Rihanna, Adele, Frank Ocean, twenty one pilots, and the Hamilton soundtrack. And it created a playlist of “Top Songs of 2016” for Apple Music right here. You can also check out its picks for best movies and TV shows below:
