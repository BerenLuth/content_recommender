Gigabyte’s upgraded Aero 14 is a super-thin VR ready laptop - The Verge
Chaim Gartenberg
At 0.78 inches thick, Gigabyte's Aero 14 laptop is one of the thinnest gaming PCs around. And now, the Aero 14 is getting a serious boost in power with an announcement last week that it’s upgrading to Nvidia's newest GeForce GTX 1060 GPU.
Along with the new, VR-ready GPU, the Aero 14 also offers a 14-inch QHD display, and maxes out at a 1TB SSD for storage and 32GB of RAM. It's also got a massive 94.24 Wh battery, although Gigabyte isn't giving any estimates beyond "long battery life." And despite the new graphics card, the Aero 14 still only offers an older, sixth generation Intel processor.
All in all, it's a pretty nice upgrade if you're in the market for a good portable gaming computer. No price or release date for the upgraded Aero 14 has been announced yet.
