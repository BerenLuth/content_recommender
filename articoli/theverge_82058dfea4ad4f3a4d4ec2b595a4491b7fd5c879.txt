Get $100 off the HTC Vive during Black Friday - The Verge
Adi Robertson
If you’ve been biding your time to get an HTC Vive, you can save $100 on one later this week. On Black Friday and Cyber Monday, HTC is dropping the Vive’s price at all online and retail stores, including Amazon and the official Vive site. That means it will sell for $699 “while supplies last,” the first big discount we’ve seen of a high-end VR headset. HTC’s site has a list of available retailers, as well as a map of brick-and-mortar stores with the Vive.
Viveport, HTC’s VR experience catalog, will also have some discounted titles. The full list is here, and includes relatively small projects like Cloudlands: VR Minigolf, horror game A Chair in a Room: Greenwater, and World of Diving.
Even with the price drop, the Vive remains the most expensive home VR headset. Sony’s PlayStation VR launch bundle is $499, and the Oculus Rift is $599, although its motion controllers — which won’t be out until December 6th — cost an extra $199. You’ll still need a recent, high-end gaming PC to use the Vive, and it’s far from an impulse buy.
But it’s a solid discount, coming at a good time. Although HTC has made some nebulous statements about new VR hardware for arcades, it’s relatively unlikely that we’ll see a massively redesigned Vive in the near future. The recently announced wireless upgrade is an aftermarket accessory, and while co-creator Valve has showed off some new controllers, they appear to be very early prototypes. Just make sure you’re ready for the slightly complicated setup process — and consider spending some of your $100 in savings on stands for the tracking stations.
