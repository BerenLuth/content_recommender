Apple's new MacBook Pro might ditch regular USB ports - The Verge

Apple has long been rumored to be preparing to launch an updated MacBook Pro model this year. While the company's iPhone event came and went without a mention of Macs, recent rumors have suggested the new MacBook Pro may arrive at an event on October 27th. A new report from Macotakara suggests that Apple is still planning to launch its new MacBook Pro later this month, and the company might unveil a refreshed 13-inch MacBook Air at the same time.
Apple is said to be including USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 ports on the new MacBook Pro, and ditching traditional USB ports and the company's MagSafe charging connector. That might surprise potential MacBook Pro owners, but it's the same strategy that Apple used in its 12-inch MacBook. Many will be hoping that Apple manages to squeeze more than one USB Type-C port inside the new MacBook Pro, though, and that it leaves the headphone jack alone for now.
Apple's touchscreen OLED strip will be the star of the MacBook Pro
Apple's new MacBook Pro is also expected to include a "Dynamic Function Row," which replaces the top row of function keys with a touchscreen OLED strip that allows keys to be dynamic to match applications. Apple is also reportedly slimming down the MacBook Pro to include a flatter keyboard.
On the MacBook Air side, Macotakara reports that Apple will kill off the 11-inch version of its popular laptop in favor of the 13-inch model. Previous reports suggest that Apple may also include USB Type-C on the new MacBook Air, which could mean the Air will also lose its traditional USB ports.
