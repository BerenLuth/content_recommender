Google Photos now has over 200 million monthly active users after only a year of existence, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced at I/O today. Users have created more than 2 trillion labels that help the company sort its Google Image search results, and 24 billion of those are selfies.
"Google Photos shows what's possible when you approach an existing area from a new perspective," he said.
The company unveiled its Photos service at last year's I/O. Since that time, Google's continued to improve upon it, including an update in March that automatically groups photos together by specific trips and locations and improved photo editing.
