Fujifilm announces a newer, faster instant printer for your phone - The Verge
Sean O'Kane
Fujifilm has announced the second version of its portable instant film printers, the Instax Share SP-2. It's the first update to the company's tiny printer lineup since the first Instax Share was released at CES in 2014, and the new model is supposed to be faster, more reliable, and comes with more customization options.
But in case you're not familiar, let's rewind real quick. The Instax Share printers use Fujifilm's 2-inch-by-3-inch Instax Mini instant film, and they're made to be used with your smartphone. You can use them to print photos from your camera roll or from services like Instagram and Facebook, and the prints can be customized to show stats like the amount of likes or hearts each photo got, or even where it was taken.

The new Instax Share SP-2 does all of this and a little bit more. It prints the photos faster — 10 seconds instead of 16 — and there is a new array of options for customization. You can adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation, or apply stock creative filters to each photo that you print, and the app — which Fujifilm says has been overhauled from the previous version — is also capable of printing collages of images, too.
The Instax Share SP-2 will be available in July in silver or gold finishes. Just like its predecessor, it will cost $199 in the United States. A double pack of Fujifilm's Instax Mini instant film (20 exposures) will be sold separately for $19.95.
