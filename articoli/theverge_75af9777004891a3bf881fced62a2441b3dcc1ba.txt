GoPro is going to show off its Karma drone for the first time on September 19th, according to a short teaser video posted to the company’s Twitter account. The company has been very tight-lipped about Karma, having only released a few short sample clips that were shot using the drone.
We first learned that GoPro was making a quadcopter in May of 2015 at Code Conference, where CEO Nick Woodman called it “the ultimate GoPro accessory.” Back then, the company promised that the product — later revealed to be called Karma — would be released in the first half of 2016.

This past May, GoPro pushed that release date all the way back to winter of 2016. It now plans to release Karma alongside the Hero 5 — GoPro’s first flagship camera in two years — in time for the holidays.
It also seems like a good bet that the Hero 5 could be unveiled on the same day as Karma. In a piece published this week about GoPro’s expansion into making its own shows, Variety says that “GoPro is expected to officially unveil its next-generation consumer camera, dubbed the Hero 5, in the coming weeks.”
