Moto likely to release a Tango mod for the Z - The Verge
Dan Seifert
In a briefing with press today, Motorola Mobility chairman and president Aymar de Lencquesaing said that the company will likely develop a Tango augmented reality mod for the Moto Z line of smartphones. De Lencquesaing did not say when the mod would be released or how much it would cost. Other Moto Mods already released range in price from $99 to $299.
Lenovo itself recently released the Phab 2 Pro, the first consumer Tango phone, but it’s a 6.4-inch, near-tablet sized device. A mod for the 5.5-inch Moto Z would provide a much more practical phone to use and allow users to add or remove the Tango functionality as they desired.
In addition, Lenovo and Moto will be combining many of their global branding efforts under the Moto banner, meaning that fewer markets will see Lenovo branded products in the future. Chief marketing officer Jan Huckfeldt says that the company’s marketing efforts for 2017 will focus around the Moto, ThinkPad, Yoga, and ThinkServer, for each of the company’s businesses. The Moto brand will be Lenovo’s main mobile device brand, though devices in some markets where Lenovo’s brand is strong, such as India, will remain.
