Google’s Daydream VR headset is coming November 10th - The Verge

The Daydream View, Google’s new virtual reality headset, is officially coming November 10th. Google announced the news in a blog post today, and opened a Google Store page for the $79 headset, which can now be preordered. Verizon and Best Buy are also selling the Daydream View in the US, and other retailers and mobile companies will carry it in Canada, the UK, Germany, and Australia.
The View is the first of what Google hopes will be many headsets to support its upcoming Daydream VR platform, which is built into Android Nougat. For now, it requires Google’s recently announced Pixel or Pixel XL phone to work, but other compatible phones are supposed to be announced in the coming months.
Currently, the View is only available in one color, Slate. Two additional colors, Crimson and Snow, will be available later. All headsets are made of soft cloth and foam, with a plastic frame. The Daydream View headset package includes a plastic remote control that charges via USB-C; you can buy a cable separately or use the one that came with the Pixel.
Daydream is the followup to Google’s cheaper, simpler, and less sophisticated Cardboard platform. A variety of apps will be available at launch, including VR news apps from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, games like turret shooter Gunjack 2 and puzzler Danger Goat, and experiences like a tie-in to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.
