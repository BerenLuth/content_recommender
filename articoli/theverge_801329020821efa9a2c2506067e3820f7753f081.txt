Do you need your next phone to be VR capable? - The Verge
Paul Miller
There's a bifurcation coming. I know, because I just Googled "bifurcation" to see if I was using the right word, and I saw this huge headline:
Weird, right?
Anyway, it got me thinking. The last Android phone I bought was the Galaxy S6, specifically because it did VR. I don't actually use it outside of VR, or the occasional reminder that you can purchase Audible books right inside the app on Android. I'm primarily an iOS user.
But I know a lot of people use Android as a phone, not just an overpriced VR headset. Right now, if you're looking for a phone, you basically have a choice between Samsung (if you want good VR, or just like curved edges on things), and everybody else. But not too long from now you'll be able to choose between a great, affordable phone that doesn't do VR, and theÂ Daydream-compatible top of the line from Google-compliant manufacturers.
So, will Daydream force your hand? Is Cardboard good enough for your tastes? Does VR still need a killer app on mobile to get you interested? Are non-VR phones a no-buy once Daydream launches, or is VR just a nice-to-have?
