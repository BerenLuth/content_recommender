The best Black Friday 2016 phone deals at Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and more - The Verge
Jacob Kastrenakes
Smartphones don’t get the kind of eye-popping, fight-in-the-aisles quality deals that TVs do on Black Friday, but stores are still offering plenty of incentives to pick one up this weekend. For the most part, that means bundles on today’s top phones that don’t necessarily lower their price, but do end up giving you more for your money. Here’s the best of what we’ve spotted.
Buy “any” Apple or Samsung smartphone on a Verizon or AT&T installment plan, get a $250 Walmart gift card (note that “any” does not include Samsung’s Galaxy J3 or any phone that’s being sold at a discounted price)
Buy an Apple Watch Series 1 for $198, about $70 off the normal retail price.
Buy an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus on a Verizon, AT&T, or Sprint installment plan, get a $250 Target gift card
Buy a Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge on a Verizon, AT&T, or Sprint installment plan, get a $250 Target gift card and a Gear VR
Buy a Galaxy S7 on a Verizon or AT&T installment plan, get a $200 Costco gift card (via mail-in rebate), two card mounts, a car charger, and a battery pack
