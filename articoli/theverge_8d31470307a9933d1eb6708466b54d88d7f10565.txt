Instagram is launching is first-ever advertising campaign, beginning this summer in France. As first reported by French business daily Les Echos, the Facebook-owned photo sharing app will roll out ads on the internet, in movie theaters, and on outdoor displays in France, as part of a campaign that will run through August. An Instagram spokesperson confirmed the report in an email to The Verge, adding that "images and videos from everyday French Instagrammers" will be "at the center of the campaign."
The announcement comes as France prepares to host the UEFA Euro 2016 soccer tournament, which begins this Friday. It also comes as Instagram faces increased competition from Snapchat, which according to a recent survey, is now the most popular social network among teenagers.
Animations like this will be shown on outdoor displays and in metro stations.
"We are still growing, but it is mostly a way to celebrate our Instagram community, [which is] very active in France," Laurent Solly, head of Facebook France, tells Les Echos. Instagram has not disclosed its investment in the campaign, but Solly tells the newspaper that it is "significant."
The app has undergone several changes in recent months, including a new black-and-white design, a revamped logo, and an algorithm-based image feed. Last week, Instagram officially launched a suite of tools for businesses, including analytics services and a new contact button for business profiles. Earlier this year, the app announced that it had more than 200,000 advertisers on its platform.
