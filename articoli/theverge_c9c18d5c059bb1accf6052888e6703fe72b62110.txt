The NFL is making a virtual reality series for YouTube and Google Daydream - The Verge

Starting this month, the NFL is bringing a 9-part series filmed in 360-degree VR to YouTube. It’ll be available to watch with Google’s Daydream View headset sometime later this year. NFL Films is currently producing the series using Google Jump, the company’s 360-degree capture system.
The debut episode will launch on the NFL’s YouTube channel on Thanksgiving Day (November 24th) and will let viewers “spend a week with the Philadelphia Eagles defensive line as they prepare for the upcoming matchup and gain exclusive access to the Eagles bench and sideline on game day.” As for what comes after that, this is what the NFL says fans can expect:
Other episodes will give viewers the opportunity to tag along with the Miami Dolphins cheerleaders, experience the distinctive football culture in Green Bay, and take a unique look inside the San Diego Chargers organization, to name a few.
The league is making a big deal about this being its “first foray into producing content in virtual reality” after some tests and experiments last season. It’s also claimed to be the first episodic sports program made for VR, though we’ve already seen some other impressive sports-centric content from the NBA and Oculus. (The NBA is also streaming one complete game every week this season in VR.)
But to recap for the NFL side, in 2016 you can stream Thursday Night Football on Twitter, watch an exclusive documentary series on Amazon Video, and soon strap Cardboard or Daydream View to your face and experience the gridiron in VR.  Not bad.
