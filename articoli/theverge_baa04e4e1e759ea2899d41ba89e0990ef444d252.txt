LG promotes home appliances boss to CEO - The Verge
Sam Byford
LG Electronics has a new CEO: Jo Seong-jin, formerly head of the home appliances division and a 40-year veteran of the company. The move comes just a year after LG appointed three “representative directors,” including Jo, to run the company at the executive level. The shakeup removed the position of CEO, but Jo has now been further promoted to that role, giving him additional authority over LG's operations in mobile and home entertainment.
Before becoming head of the overall home appliances business, Jo ran LG's washing machine division and was part of the team that developed the first LG automatic washing machine in 1980. In a statement, LG says that Jo was more recently “instrumental in LG’s move into premium appliances with the introduction of the LG Signature brand and built-in Signature Kitchen Suite as well as building the foundation for future businesses in the areas of IoT and smart homes.”
Jo's name may also sound familiar if you followed the bizarre feud between LG and Samsung a couple of years back. Samsung accused Jo of deliberately sabotaging of its washing machines at IFA 2014; LG responded by countersuing Samsung and releasing video footage that it said absolved Jo. The two companies eventually decided to call off the entire dispute.
