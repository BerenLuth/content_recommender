Read the arguments from the Apple v. Samsung Supreme Court case - The Verge
Jacob Kastrenakes
Apple and Samsung brought their long-running patent case to the Supreme Court this morning for an hour of oral arguments. We have a detailed writeup from the courtroom right here. But if you’re interested in the specifics of the case, you can now read a full transcript of the arguments on the court’s website.
The question at hand is exactly how a jury should determine monetary damages for a design patent: Samsung had to pay Apple nearly $400 million for infringing several iPhone patents; it’s arguing that the total should be reduced, limited to damages specifically related to the infringed patents. The damages currently take into account profits from the entire phone.
What direction is the court leaning? Are there any sick burns from RBG? Read the transcript to find out.
