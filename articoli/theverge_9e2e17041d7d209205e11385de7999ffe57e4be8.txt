Microsoft details Windows 10 VR minimum PC specs - The Verge
Tom Warren
Microsoft accidentally revealed some of its minimum PC specs for Windows 10 VR headsets last month, but the company is fully detailing its plans today. The minimum specs essentially mean that most modern PCs will be able to run Windows 10 VR experiences, but games and apps will vary depending on the available specs to power them. Here's the full minimum specs:
These specifications have been determined through a partnership with Intel, codenamed Project Evo. Microsoft and Intel are working together to bring what the pair called mixed reality (augmented reality) to life through Windows 10 PCs. Microsoft has also submitted HoloLens to the Chinese government for approval, and it plans to make the headset available to developers in China in the first half of 2017. 3Glasses will join other headsets makers to support Windows 10 with its S1 HMD next year.
Microsoft is also planning to allow developers to start testing Windows 10 VR headsets in February. Developer kits will be available the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, ahead of retail headsets from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo.
Microsoft still isn’t fully detailing exactly what the experience of Windows 10 VR will be like, and how it will differ to HoloLens, but the company will support 360-degree video in the Movie & TV app, and WebVR support through Microsoft Edge. We’ll likely start to see more on the Windows 10 VR experience early next year.
