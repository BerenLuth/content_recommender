Get the Google Home speaker for $99 at Best Buy on Black Friday - The Verge
Nick Statt
The new Google Home smart speaker is $30 off at Best Buy next week as part of the retailer’s Black Friday deals. The Home normally retails for $130, and you can get it for $99 plus six months of free YouTube Red, the video site’s ad-free subscription service, if you manage to snag the deal between November 24th and November 26th. Best Buy’s ad indicates that the deal is not restricted to in-store purchase only, so the web store listing link for the Home should reflect the price change after 5PM ET on Thanksgiving Day.
While it does have its limitations now just a little over a month after launch, Google Home is a solid alternative to Amazon’s Echo speaker. Instead of using a personified AI, like the Echo’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri, Google relies on voice-powered variation of its Google Assistant, the same software that powers its new Allo chat app. Still, these speakers are mostly used to play music, get basic web info, and do small tasks like setting timers and checking directions. You can pair more than one together for a Sonos-like effect, if you’re interested in purchasing more than one.
Google does have one thing going for it that others don’t: its Chromecast family of devices gives the Home an easy communication link to your media center, should you happen to own a Chromecast Audio or the standard Chromecast. If you’re interested in comparing these deals with Amazon’s, the online retailer is running its own Echo promotions for Black Friday, including the standard speaker for $139.99, the Echo Dot for $39.99, and the Amazon Tap for $89.99.
