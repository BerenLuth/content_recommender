Join us this summer for a TIFF and The Verge VR Showcase - The Verge
Ross Miller
It's been a landmark year for VR. Major headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are finally (slowly) getting into homes, while on the other extreme, Cardboard headsets are finding their way into more and more bags / backpacks / purses. And yet it's still very early as both a technology and an art form, albeit one that's being embraced enthusiastically.
With that in mind, we're pleased to announce that The Verge is partnering with the Toronto International Film Festival on a three-part summer series, POP, that will explore all facets of VR storytelling. TIFF is one of the most prestigious film festivals in the world, and we're very proud to collaborate on this little experiment.
There will be three events in total — we'll be collaborating on the POP 02, slated for July 15–July 17 — each with a collection of curated VR experiences and lively moderated discussions. (The other two partners are The Fader and National Film Board of Canada.) It all takes place at TIFF Bell Lightbox, a 3,500-square foot exhibition space in Toronto.
It's going to be an incredible experience, and we'll have more details shortly. Tickets for July's POP 02 will go on sale in mid-June, while tickets for the first POP are on sale now via POP's website. We'll see you there!
This summer we'll showcase #TIFFxPOP, a series of immersive, pop-up #VR installations https://t.co/i26izrRlan pic.twitter.com/k71g5O6aAe
