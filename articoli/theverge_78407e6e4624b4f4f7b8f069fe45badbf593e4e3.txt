You can now use Skype without an account - The Verge

Microsoft is making Skype a little easier to use without the need for a full account. While Skype has allowed group chats with guests, Microsoft is now enabling all of Skype's audio and video calling features to be used without an account. Skype users can create a special conversation that link that can now be shared with anyone to enable messaging, voice / video calling, and screen sharing, all free without an account.
Skype without an account works on the web, and up to 300 people can participate in a Skype group chat, with up to 25 people on a voice or video call. If you use Skype as a guest then the conversation will only last for 24 hours, and if you want to access features like calling landlines or Skype Translator then you'll still need a regular Skype account. To start a Skype conversation without an account, simply head to the Skype website and hit "start a conversation" to create a group chat that can be shared with anyone. We've started one for The Verge, so feel free to jump in and see how it works right here.
