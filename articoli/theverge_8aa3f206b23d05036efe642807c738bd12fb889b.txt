HTC’s virtual reality app store launches today - The Verge
Adi Robertson
Viveport, HTC’s app store for its Vive virtual reality headset, is going online worldwide today. Viveport opened exclusively in China this spring, and developers were able to register for a larger beta last month, but the store is now launching publicly in around 30 countries. As part of a 48-hour launch celebration, several Vive titles will be discounted to $1: a new version of Wevr’s theBlu, The Music Room Mini, Mars Odyssey, Firebird - La Peri, and Stonehenge VR.
Currently, HTC Vive owners can buy and run apps and games directly through Steam, or download them from third-party services like Itch.io. But Viveport is supposed to make it easier for non-gaming experiences to get noticed. And while many people will probably still go through Steam, having more competing platforms is good for both customers and developers.
