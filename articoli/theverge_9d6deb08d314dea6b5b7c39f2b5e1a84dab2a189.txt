Jide wants to put its desktop-focused Android fork on your TV - The Verge
James Vincent
Jide, the Chinese firm behind desktop-orientated Android fork Remix OS, wants to supercharge your TV. The company has launched a Kickstarter campaign for what it's calling Remix IO — a small hardware box that runs Remix OS. Plug it into your TV, and you can use it to do anything you can on Android. Play games, use apps, and with the desktop features of Remix OS you can also plug in a keyboard and mouse for tasks like browsing the web or writing emails. The cheapest Kickstarter tier gets you the Remix IO for $99, with the product expected to ship worldwide in March 2017.

Jide Remix IO
At heart, the Remix IO is just an updated version of the Remix Mini, which Jide Kickstarted all the way back in 2015. It's got a faster processor (a 1.5GHz ARM Cortex A53) and a bit more connectivity (including a VGA port for plugging it into projectors), but it's the same basic sell — get Android on any screen you like. However, that was a big hit for Jide with the Remix Mini, and the company has improved Remix OS since then, adding more features and making it more stable. Remix IO looks to be more of a good thing.
