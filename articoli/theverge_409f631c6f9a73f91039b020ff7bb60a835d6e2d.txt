HTC’s Bolt arrives for the rest of the world as the 10 evo - The Verge
Dan Seifert
HTC is announcing today that the Bolt smartphone, recently released for Sprint in the US, will be coming to the rest of the world as the HTC 10 evo. The 10 evo has the same design and features as the Bolt, including its IP57 water resistance rating and unibody metal frame. It will be available in markets worldwide this month in gunmetal, silver, and gold.
Though the Bolt and 10 evo are HTC’s first metal unibody phones with water resistance, they have rather dated specs. A Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB of RAM, and QuickCharge 2.0 fast charging were high-end in 2015, but in late 2016, they are distinctly behind the curve. A 5.5-inch, quad-HD display and 16-megapixel optically stabilized camera round out the spec sheet.
The 10 evo looks very similar to the HTC 10 from earlier this year, but it has a larger, flatter design and lacks a headphone jack. HTC is packing a set of USB Type-C headphones in the box with the device to make up for the fact that it can’t use standard 3.5mm headphones.
HTC is not announcing pricing for the 10 evo at this time, but the Bolt sells for about $600, so it’s likely that the 10 evo will be similarly priced when it hits shelves.
