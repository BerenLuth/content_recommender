Amazon will sell more PlayStation VR bundles starting tomorrow - The Verge
Nick Statt
Sony's PlayStation VR headset doesn't start shipping until October, but preorders for the virtual reality headset are already going fast. Amazon's stock quickly sold out after its page went live on Tuesday, but those who missed the first round will have an opportunity to plunk down $499 for a second, limited round of preorders starting at 5PM ET tomorrow, according to a tweet from Amazon's video game-related Twitter account this evening. Of course, both GameStop and BestBuy still have the bundle preorders available, and both offer free shipping, so it's not imperative you snag it from Amazon unless you really want to.
PlayStation VR may be arriving late to the party, as both the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive begin shipping in the next couple of weeks. However, Sony's lower price is proving to be a big selling point. The $500 bundle includes the PlayStation VR headset, a PlayStation Camera, two PlayStation Move controllers, and a copy of the launch game PlayStation VR Worlds.
Good news! We're getting more #PlayStationVR bundles in. They'll be available for purchase at 2pm tomorrow. https://t.co/tlbPYnee0J
It's a solid deal for console gamers who don't want to spend $599 on the Rift or $799 on the Vive, as well as those who don't have the requisite pricey gaming PC to power them. For those who already own a PlayStation Camera and Move controllers, Sony says some retailers will start offering preorders of the standalone PlayStation VR headset for $399 starting on Tuesday, March 29th at 10AM ET.
Update at 10:00PM ET at Wednesday, March 23rd: Included Sony's statement that preorders for a standalone PlayStation VR headset would begin on March 29th.
