Watch Google’s Pixel phone event in 10 minutes - The Verge
Nick Statt
Google’s Pixel hardware event today unleashed a torrent of news and product announcements on the tech world. We got to see two new phones, a new virtual reality headset, a tiny puck-sized router, a 4K-ready Chromecast, and pricing and availability for the new Google Home speaker. For Google — which tends not to have big, splashy events outside its I/O developer conference every May — today marked its most significant hardware push in years.
If you’re still trying to wrap your head around everything the company showed off, you’re in luck. We’ve boiled the 117-minute presentation down to 10 minutes of essential video. Check it out to catch up on Google's ambitious play to control every bit of consumer computing and entertainment, from the smartphone to home appliances to internet connectivity.
