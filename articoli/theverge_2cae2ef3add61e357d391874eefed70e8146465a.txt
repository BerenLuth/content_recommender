The Pixel will come in Quite Black, Really Blue, and Very Silver - The Verge
Russell Brandom
With its newly revealed Pixel phones, Google didn’t settle for just black, blue, or silver. The official colors for the Pixel and Pixel XL will be Quite Black, Really Blue, and Very Silver, Google's Sabrina Ellis announced onstage at today's keynote.
Really Blue will be available as a limited edition, and a subsequent video identified it as "a blue so blue we created it new." Ellis did not elaborate on what distinguishes the Pixel’s Really Blue from the more quotidian shades of blue we encounter in everyday life.
The colors give Google's new phones a clear edge on Apple, which earlier this year announced Jet Black and Matte Black finishes for the iPhone 7. The basic principles of language indicate that Quite Black is more black than Jet Black or Matte Black, and thus will be more appealing to users seeking the blackest available phone.
