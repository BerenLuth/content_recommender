One week after it unveils new hardware, Microsoft will shift focus to software and its Office suite. The company just sent out invites for a media event on November 2nd in Manhattan, where CEO Satya Nadella, Office CVP Kirk Koenigsbauer, and "special guests" plan to reveal how Microsoft will "empower every team to achieve more."
The invite's language seems very business-oriented, so the event will be in all likelihood be concentrated on collaboration and new ways for those in the enterprise to "connect and create together." But it's big enough to prompt an appearance from Microsoft's chief executive, so it'll be interesting to see what Microsoft's next steps will be in its continued rivalry with Google Docs and other productivity software.
A few days earlier on October 26th, we're expecting to see Microsoft present more exciting news for consumers. AÂ Surface all-in-one PC is likely on the agenda, in addition to some Xbox announcements and details on the company's next Windows 10 updates.
