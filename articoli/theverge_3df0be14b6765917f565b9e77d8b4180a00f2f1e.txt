Sony's new flagship camera shoots 12 42-megapixel photos per second - The Verge

Sony has today announced a new flagship interchangeable lens camera, the A99 II. The new camera has a DSLR-style body with a full-frame, 42.4-megapixel sensor. It also has a new hybrid phase detection autofocus system that has 79 dedicated cross points and 399 supplemental points. Sony has packed all of its imaging technology into this camera, including a 5-axis image stabilization system and 4K video recording with full pixel readout.
Sony says this camera is targeted toward pros, sport photographers, and wildlife photographers. It is compatible with the A-system line of lenses. Sony claims that its hybrid autofocus system enables it to work better in dim light with greater accuracy (up to -4 EV). The image sensor has an expanded ISO range of 50 to 102,400 and does not have a low pass filter, which Sony says ensures better image quality. The image stabilization system provides up to 4.5 stops of correction with any A-system lens mounted to the camera.
Sony has made great strides with its Alpha line of cameras since their debut 10 years ago, dominating the mirrorless camera world. With the A99 II, it’s setting its sights on Canon’s stronghold of pro sports photographers, and if the camera is as good as Sony claims, it could cause some concern for Canon. The A99 II will be available in November for $3,200.
