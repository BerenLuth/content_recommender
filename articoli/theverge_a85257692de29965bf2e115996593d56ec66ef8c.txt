Now that it’s arguably the standard for digital comics online and on mobile devices, Comixology has announced that it will start producing original comics. Called comiXology Originals, the new program will showcase content from both creators and publishers, with debut titles coming from Boom! Studios, Valiant Entertainment, and late, great cartoonist and Mad editor Harvey Kurtzman.
Comixology is making the digital-only original titles available to both Comixology and Kindle customers. Among the new comics will be Adventure Time Marshall Lee Spectacular by award-winning writer Mariko Tamaki, which follows Marshall Lee from Cartoon Network’s critically acclaimed Adventure Time!, and Harvey Kurtzman’s Marley’s Ghost, which will be a completed version of Kurtzman’s first attempt at a graphic novel.
"Our mission is to make everyone on the face of the planet a comic fan, and with comiXology Originals we’re excited to offer a range of content by diverse creators," said Comixology CEO David Steinberger in an official statement. "It’s fantastic to be working with publishers across the spectrum to deliver great comics to comiXology and Kindle, offering fans stories that they can’t get anywhere else."
Comixology already features self-published comics from a number of creators, but this new initiative shows the company working with the comics industry in a big way to make titles for digital-only audiences. The company also launched a subscription service earlier this year called Comixology Unlimited, which allows subscribers to read titles from popular indie imprints like Dark Horse and Image. It’s not clear what other deals are ahead, but the service is shaping up to be a must for anyone with a passing interest in the medium.
