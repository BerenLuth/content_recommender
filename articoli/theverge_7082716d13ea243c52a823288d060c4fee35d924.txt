You can actually buy Zotac’s VR backpack PC now - The Verge
Chaim Gartenberg
Zotac released the VR Go today, joining MSI in the relatively small club of companies that are actually shipping wearable VR backpacks. For those who are unfamiliar, VR backpacks are wearable gaming computers meant to allow for untethered room-scale virtual reality environments — they’re the future of VR, at least until we manage to advance technology for wireless headsets or can compress the demanding hardware for virtual reality into a more easily worn form factor.
The Zotac VR Go offers around two hours of battery life per charge, with hot-swappable batteries to let you quickly get back into the action. While that may not sound like a lot, it's actually pretty good for what is essentially a wearable, battery-powered desktop gaming PC. Spec-wise, the VR Go offers an Nvidia GTX 1070 GPU, quad-core 2.8 GHz Intel Skylake Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 240GB M.2 SSD. Both the RAM and storage space can also be easily upgraded should you need more memory.
A truly portable VR system doesn't come cheap through, with Zotac selling the VR Go for $1,999.99. This is in addition to the actual VR system you'll still need to buy (unless you just want to be able to wear your computer for some reason). The Zotac VR Go is already sold out on Amazon, but you can order one now to ship as soon as more are in stock.
