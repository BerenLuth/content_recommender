Meizu's M5 Note redefines incremental improvement with 0.1mm thinner body - The Verge
James Vincent
Meizu has announced the M5 Note — an incremental update on this year’s M3 Note. The M5 Note is 0.1mm thinner than its predecessor, offers up to 2GB more RAM (a maximum of 4GB), and up to three times more internal storage (64GB maximum).
But apart from these changes, the phones are very similar, with the same 1080p 5.5-inch display, Helio P10 chipset, and 13-megapixel rear camera. The M5 Note actually has a smaller battery too (4,000 mAh instead of 4,100 mAh), as well as a fingerprint sensor and space for both dual SIMs and a microSD in the same card tray. Neat.
There’s no word on international availability, but the prices for the M5 Note are typically cheap. In China, the 3GB/16GB variant will cost ¥900 or around $130, while the   top-of-the-range 4GB/64Gb will go for ¥1,500 or $217. Depending on where you live it might be worth your trouble importing the M5 Note, but be sure to check if the phone supports LTE bands in your country.
And just for fun (or, you know, to take advantage of a market that seems pretty cheap to enter), Meizu is also releasing a basic fitness tracker named the Meizu Band. It costs  ¥229 (about $33) and has an OLED touch display and heart rate monitor. It won’t be available internationally, but, like the M5 Note, will launch in China December 8th.
