Canon's new macro lens has a built-in ring flash - The Verge
Sam Byford
There are two surprising things about Canon's new EF-M 28mm f/3.5 Macro IS STM lens.
It's unexpected enough to get a macro lens for the EOS M system, but for it to be such a unique product (esoteric 1980s medical optics from Nikon notwithstanding) is even more so. We'll have to wait a bit to see how well it works in practice, though — the EF-M 28mm F3.5 Macro IS STM is due out in June for $299.99.
