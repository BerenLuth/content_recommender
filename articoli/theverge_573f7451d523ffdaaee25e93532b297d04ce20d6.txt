Apple is reportedly releasing two versions of its 5.5-inch iPhone next year - The Verge

Apple will reportedly release two different 5.5-inch iPhones in 2017, one of which will feature an OLED display, according to a 9to5Mac, which viewed a report from Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst at KGI Securities. This isn’t the first Kuo has mentioned an OLED display. Earlier this year, he made the same prediction, and clearly he believes OLED is in Apple’s future. We also already heard rumors that Apple would be releasing three iPhone models in 2017, including a 4.7-inch iPhone with a LCD display and single camera.
Kuo doesn’t mention a curved display or a new form factor, like a bezel-less design, which was previously rumored. The firm does note, however, that it suspects the new phones will be made entirely of glass. Settle in; Apple rumor season is only getting started.
