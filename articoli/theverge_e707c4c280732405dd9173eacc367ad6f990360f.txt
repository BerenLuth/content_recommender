Google is bringing Android app support to four more Chromebooks - The Verge
Nick Statt
Google released a developer update to Chrome OS today that brings Android app support to four new Chromebook models. The laptops include the Dell Chromebook 13, HP 13, Samsung Chromebook 3, and ASUS C301SA. If you’d like to get access to the Google Play Store on any one of these machines, you have to run the most recent developer version of Chrome OS, which may contain bugs and other rough edges when it comes to full Android app support.
Running Android apps in a laptop environment was first announced back at the Google I/O developer conference in May. Since then, Google has slowly built out the feature and pushed beta versions of it through its Chrome OS developer channel. To try it out, check to see that you have one of these supported Chromebooks. And then make sure you’re running the most up-to-date version of Chrome OS available. While some models have access to Android apps running stable versions of the software, it looks like for now the models mentioned above require you to be running the developer version.
