Sam Byford
Meizu has announced the Pro 6 Plus, a more powerful version of its Pro 6 flagship phone from earlier this year. There’s a bigger, sharper screen, a new processor, a larger battery, and more.
Here’s the list of important specs:
The Pro 6 Plus is also the first phone to run Flyme 6, the latest version of Meizu’s Android skin; it has over 400 new features, according to the company, and is powered by an “AI Engine” called One Mind, whatever that means.
The Pro 6 Plus should be out soon in China, and its LTE connectivity is expected to work around the world in case you want to import.
