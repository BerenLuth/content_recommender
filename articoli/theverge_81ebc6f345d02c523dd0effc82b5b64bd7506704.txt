IMAX is getting the first shipment of headsets for its new VR theaters - The Verge

Acer and Starbreeze teamed up to launch their StarVR headsets for arcades and theme parks earlier this year. Today Acer announced that it successfully sold the first batch of those headsets and is in the process of shipping them to the IMAX Corporation. The company plans to install StarVR in a new VR Center in Los Angeles that’ll open later this year and would be the first of six VR locations IMAX hopes to open this year.
The headsets come with a wider field of vision than the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive. StarVR displays a 210-degree field of view, whereas both the Rift and Vive project at a 110-degree field of view. With the headsets actually shipping, this is farther than many VR product designs make it, so kudos to Acer and Starbreeze. I hope tickets to this IMAX VR center aren’t more than $50!
