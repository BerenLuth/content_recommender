The Oculus Rift now officially runs on cheaper PCs - The Verge
Adi Robertson
Oculus has launched the feature that establishes a new minimum spec for its Rift headset, making it accessible on cheaper PCs. In a blog post, the company announced the addition of asynchronous spacewarp, which lets VR titles run smoothly at half the normal frame rate. While the technical process is explained in more detail here, the upshot is that as of today, the Rift is officially supported on a wider range of computers.
Oculus officially announced the existence of asynchronous spacewarp at its Connect conference last month. The recommended Oculus Rift specifications are the same as before, and will provide the best experience, Oculus’ CEO told us. But where the old standard required at least an Nvidia GTX 970 or equivalent graphics card and a recent Intel Core i5 processor, the floor is now set at a GTX 960 card and an i3 processor. (You need 8GB of memory for either.)
At launch, a machine with the recommended specs cost $1,000 or more, but Oculus approved a prebuilt $499 CyberPowerPC desktop featuring the minimum specs. So far, it doesn’t appear to be on sale, but we’ve asked Oculus for more details.
Today’s update comes not long before the release of Oculus’ Touch motion controllers, which start shipping December 6th. Along with spacewarp, Oculus provided some more images of its upcoming avatar system, and teased a new experience called First Contact, a “playful, ‘80s sci-fi throwback” that will introduce users to their new virtual hands.
