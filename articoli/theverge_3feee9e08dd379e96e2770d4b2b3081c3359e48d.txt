Instagram makes video an even bigger part of its Explore tab - The Verge
Chris Welch
Just like its parent company Facebook, Instagram has been putting a ton of work into video of late. Users can now record clips up to 60 seconds in length, and today Instagram is rolling out a revamped Explore tab that does far more than stick a lone video banner at the top. "To begin, you’ll find a personalized channel called 'Videos You Might Like' that collects videos from across Instagram’s global community into a seamless viewing experience," the Instagram team wrote in a blog post. "And as you scroll through the Explore grid, you may also see 'Featured' channels filled with videos on specific topics."
For those people that react to this change with a groan, Instagram is also underlining that this shouldn't drastically alter how Explore works. "It connects you to posts about your interests from people you don’t yet follow. The more you like, the better Explore gets, adjusting to your preferences and showing you more of the stuff you enjoy." And there's still the option to indicate to the app that you don't like certain posts. At least Instagram's not mucking up the primary feed with this stuff. For now it's still chronological, though we know changes are (eventually) coming there — no need to freak out just yet, though.
