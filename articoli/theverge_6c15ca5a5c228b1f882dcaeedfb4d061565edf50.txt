Samsung makes glossy ‘black pearl’ Galaxy S7 Edge official - The Verge
James Vincent
Samsung has announced a seventh color option for the Galaxy S7 Edge: black pearl. The finish is glossy, exclusive to the 128GB version of the handset, and will be available in unnamed “select markets” starting December 9th. Obviously Apple doesn’t have a patent on glossy black smartphones (though we wouldn’t put it past them), but the black pearl S7 Edge does make for a good companion to the iPhone 7 in jet black.
I’ve heard more than a few colleagues describe this finish as the best-looking iPhone ever, and we hope Samsung’s new Edge can match. But, of course, it’s worth remembering that if you do go for glossy, you’ve got to learn to love the scratches.
The black pearl color option for the Edge joins white pearl, black onyx, gold platinum, silver titanium, blue coral, and pink gold. Samsung says that while those last two were inspired by “calming, natural hues,” black pearl is intended to be more “modern and striking,” while capturing “the essence of the color in its purest form.” God help me I do love this nonsense.
