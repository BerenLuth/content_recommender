NextVR teams up with Live Nation to broadcast concerts in virtual reality - The Verge

The VR company responsible for many of the format's early experiments in broadcasting has set its sights on live music. NextVR, which has previously streamed boxing matches, a Democratic debate, and the Daytona 500, has partnered with events company Live Nation to "broadcast hundreds of live, cutting-edge performances in virtual reality to music fans worldwide." The company is not alone in this ambition either, with UMG and iHeartRadio announcing plans earlier this year to bring VR to some concerts.
The first show will be this summer
There are no details yet on which musical acts you'll be able to see via NextVR, but the company promises a "regular supply of world-class live music shows." As with NextVR's previous broadcasts, these will be available via Samsung's Gear VR via the Oculus Home app, with other platforms coming soon. The company says the first of its musical VR events will take place this summer, with a full schedule for the following year to come. NextVR has previously partnered with Coldplay to produce a small demo clip for its app, but this is major step up for the company.
The plan, says NextVR, is to use music to attract new VR viewers. The company has previously taken a similar approach with sporting fans, signing a five-year deal with Fox Sports which the parties claimed was the first of its kind. That deal was only made this year, though, and it's presumably too soon to tell whether or not it has yet borne fruit.
By partnering with Live Nation, though, NextVR seems like it has given itself a lot of choices, musically speaking. Live Nation's upcoming events include everything from Riverdance and Bryan Adams, to Rihanna and Beyoncé. If NextVR can get on stage with headline acts like those, then it'll certainly get a few more people dragging on their VR headsets.
