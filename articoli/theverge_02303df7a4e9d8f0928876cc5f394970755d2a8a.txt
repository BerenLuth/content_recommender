Microsoft is probably killing off its Band fitness tracker - The Verge

Last year, when The Verge’s Lauren Goode reviewed the Microsoft Band 2 she posed the question: "Why, exactly, has Microsoft made another fitness tracker?" It seems the company has been asking itself the very same question, with signs suggesting it will be discontinuing the product line this  year. ZDNet reports that sources say the company disbanded the team that was trying to get the Band to run Windows 10 (it currently works on its own firmware), and that there is no intention to release a new Band this year. When asked about Microsoft’s official plans for the product, a spokesperson told ZDNet:
"We continue to invest and innovate in the Microsoft Health platform, which is open to all hardware and apps partners across Windows, iOS, and Android devices. We also continue to sell Microsoft Band 2 and remain deeply committed to supporting our customers and exploring the wearables space."
This isn’t a definitive statement that there’ll be no Microsoft Band 3 now or in the future, but it certainly leaves the door open for such an eventuality. It’s interesting to note that Microsoft also highlights the existence of and continuing investment in its health platform, suggesting that the software could live on even if the hardware dies. The first Band was released in October 2014 for $200, with the Band 2 launching the same month in 2015 for $250. If there is more news to come — about either a Band 3 or the end to the range — we can expect to find out next month.
