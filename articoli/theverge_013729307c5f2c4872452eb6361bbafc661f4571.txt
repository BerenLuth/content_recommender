Google kicked off its Pixel event with a Silicon Valley intro - The Verge
Kwame Opam
Google’s Pixel event is starting right now, but it kicked things off with a nod from HBO’s Silicon Valley. Here, Gilfoyle (Martin Starr) and Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani) are waiting for the event — but it turns out that Gilfoyle, as a respected member of the developer community and a non-virgin, was a member of the hardware beta program. Naturally, Dinesh is upset.
Google is currently on its way to announcing its new Pixel devices, along with news about Google Assistant, Google Home, Google Wifi, and the next update of Android. Dinesh have too much to worry about. It'll all be revealed soon.
