First look at Sony's new PlayStation VR headset - The Verge

Sony just took the wraps off of the final consumer version of its PlayStation VR headset at its event at GDC 2016. The final version looks very similar to the headset Sony first showed off way back in 2014, but it has a slightly different lighting pattern on the outside. Sony says the specs and overall design is the same as the recent prototypes it has demoed. The unit has a 5.7-inch OLED display with 1920 x 1080 resolution split across both eyes, and nine LEDs that let the PlayStation camera provide positional tracking.
Sony says the PlayStation VR will be available across the world in October for $399, which is $200 less than the Oculus Rift and $400 below HTC's Vive. The company expects to have 50 games available for the PlayStation VR before the end of the year.
