We’ll be live from Sony’s PlayStation VR keynote at 5PM ET tonight - The Verge
Ross Miller
Two years ago at GDC, Sony first unveiled its VR initiative, then called Project Morpheus. Today, the company is holding a press event all about PlayStation VR â and while it isn't entirely clear what will be announced, given Oculus and Vive's rapidly approaching launch dates, we wouldn't be surprised if the company finally divulged a price and release date.
Regardless of what Sony does (or doesn't) announce, the company has a lot of games to show off at this year's GDC — and whatever they do say, as soon as we find out, you will too.
