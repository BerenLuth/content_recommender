Twitter opens its Moments feature up to everyone - The Verge
Jacob Kastrenakes
Twitter will now let any of its users create a Moment.
Moments, best known as the feature you have to swipe past to see your notifications, are collections of tweets that generally focus on a single subject. It may be people tweeting reactions to a baseball game, news updates on an emergency, or just a bunch of jokes about the presidential debate.
Will this make Moments more interesting?
At launch, it was only Twitter itself and some specific partners, like BuzzFeed and The New York Times, that were able to create a Moment. Recently, Twitter opened it up to a larger group, which included major Twitter users and some companies. The feature is becoming available to everyone today, although it appears to still be rolling out.
For now, it looks like Moments can only be created on the desktop. There’ll be a button on everyone’s profile page to start building one; it’ll then take you to a new screen where you can search for the tweets you want to add.
Most of Twitter’s iconic features have come from individual users, so it makes sense that Moments is being opened up to everyone. It’ll mean the creation of more Moments, possibly the sharing of more Moments, and the chance to have some fun with how they’re used.
Will they actually catch on? Sitting around and curating tweets isn’t exactly the type of spontaneity that Twitter thrives on. But Twitter is putting a big focus on Moments — it’s the tab right beside the Timeline, after all — so the feature’s certainly being given a real chance.
Also, Twitter Moments can be embedded on webpages. Enjoy one below.
