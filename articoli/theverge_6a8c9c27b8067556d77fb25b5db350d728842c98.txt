If you missed Mr. Robot’s VR experience during Comic-Con, it’s back online - The Verge
Adi Robertson
The Mr. Robot virtual reality experience that premiered — then quickly disappeared — last week during Comic-Con is now online for good. For anyone with a Gear VR, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or Google Cardboard, the 13-minute video is available through the Within app on these platforms. Otherwise, you can watch it as a 360-degree video on YouTube or Facebook without a VR headset.
The Mr. Robot experience is written by show creator Sam Esmail, and it captures a memory from the show’s protagonist Elliot, played by Rami Malek. It was first released as a one-time simulcast, which worked great for some people but was crippled by technical problems for others, including me. One of the people who did manage to see it, our own Bryan Bishop, is a big fan. The piece is embedded above, and links for different platforms are all collected here, with a cute "reality level" ranking for each category.
Disclosure: NBC Universal, owner of USA Network, is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company. Additionally, we are an independent editorial partner in the Mr. Robot Digital After Show hosted by The Verge.
