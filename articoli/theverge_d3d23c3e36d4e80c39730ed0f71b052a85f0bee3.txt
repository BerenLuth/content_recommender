Oculus Touch still has no release date, but promises over 30 games at launch - The Verge

Oculus still hasn't told us when its Touch motion controllers might ship, but it's saying that over 30 full virtual reality games will have support for Touch at launch — and that we'll know the full lineup and release details this fall. This suggests that the controllers will be coming out around the holidays, possibly after the release of Sony's PlayStation VR in October, and that Oculus fans will be waiting a while yet for feature parity with the HTC Vive. Ideally, they'll get a launch catalog that makes this worth it.
We've already seen (or at least heard about) several of the launch titles, including Rock Band VR, escape game I Expect You to Die, and wizard dueling game he Unspoken. Some — like Job Simulator and Fantastic Contraption — are already out on Vive, and at least one — Crytek's rock-climbing game The Climb — was already released on the Rift without Touch controls. Oculus, however, promises that 20 will be "brand new" games built for Touch. The total number is similar to the Oculus Rift headset's 29-game launch catalog, although Oculus says there are "hundreds of additional Touch titles" in development.
Some of these games will be exclusive to the Oculus Rift and Touch, at least at first. One of them is Wilson's Heart, a narrative-focused "psychological thriller" by 'Splosion Man studio Twisted Pixel, and another is a competitive multiplayer game called Ripcoil, which sounds a lot like CCP's Tron-like game Project Arena. While it's not a game, you've also got Oculus Medium, a sculpting tool that will ship with Touch. Hopefully, we'll get to try some of the new projects later this week, when Oculus opens up its demo booth.
