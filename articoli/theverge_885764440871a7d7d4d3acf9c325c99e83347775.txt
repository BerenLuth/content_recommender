YouTube now supports 4K live-streaming for both 360-degree and standard video - The Verge

YouTube now supports 4K live-streaming, allowing content creators to broadcast using high-resolution video in both 360-degree and standard video formats at a rate of 60 frames per second, the company announced today.
The update comes just a few weeks after YouTube added 4K HDR support. Given that standard 4K content is still easier to film and is more accessible than 4K HDR content, it's a great update for both YouTube creators and viewers. Creators can start live-streaming in 4K today, but if you’re on the viewer’s side and want to know what that’ll look like, YouTube’s partnering with The Game Awards to live stream the entire show under the new format on December 1st at 8:30PM ET.
As more devices with 4K live-streaming support come onto market, here’s hoping it’ll be the new standard for live-streaming just about anything. Puppy cams? Yes, please. Watching butter melt? Hell yeah. Okay, fine, concert festivals are probably the most ideal use case, but a girl can dream.
