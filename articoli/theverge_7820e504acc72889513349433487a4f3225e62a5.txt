Alcatel is releasing a VR headset that doesn't use a phone but whyyy - The Verge

Alcatel announced at IFA this week that it’s going to be releasing a VR headset called Vision that won’t require a phone. Engadget reports that everything, including an eight-core CPU, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and sensors, like an accelerometer, gyroscope, and proximity sensor, will be stuffed inside. The display will consists of two 3.8-inch AMOLEDs with 1080 x 1020 resolution for each eye, and the battery can reportedly last between three and four hours. For comparison, the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive’s have 1080 x 1200 resolution for each eye. We don't yet have pricing info.
Others, like Qualcomm and Pico have developed similar products, but nobody, including Alcatel, can explain why it's a good idea yet. The biggest hurdle for any VR headset is content, and these unique devices from smaller brands are going to have it the worst. Alcatel is reportedly developing its own SDK and is partnering with companies to bring games and content to the headsets. That being said, without a partnership with Oculus or any other major VR software developers, it’s likely going to be a hard sell to get consumers to buy a relatively unknown company’s VR gear.
